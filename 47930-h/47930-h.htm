<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Luckily</span> the war has made eggs too
expensive for me to fear the public will pelt me off the stage
with them.</p>
<p>Still after years of writing one naturally dreads the cold
potato and the orange-peel.</p>
<p>I once in talking said to a celebrated dancer who was about to
bid farewell to her admirers and retire to private life,
&ldquo;Perhaps you will take a benefit when you come back from
finishing your last tour.&rdquo;&nbsp; She answered, &ldquo;Yes .
. .&rdquo;; and then added, &ldquo;or perhaps two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is not my way, for all my life I have loved bread, bread,
and wine, wine, not caring for half-measures, like your true
Scot, of whom it has been said, &ldquo;If he believes in
Christianity he has no doubts, and if he is a disbeliever he has
none either.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>Once in the Sierra Madre, either near the Santa Rosa
Mountains or in the Bolson de M&aacute;pimi, I disremember which,
out after horses that had strayed, we came upon a little shelter
made of withies, and covered with one of those striped blankets
woven by the Navajos.</p>
<p>A Texan who was with the party pointed to it, and said,
&ldquo;That is a wickey-up, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little wigwam, shaped like a gipsy tent, stood close to a
thicket of huisach&eacute; trees in flower.&nbsp; Their round and
ball-like blossoms filled the air with a sweet scent.&nbsp; A
stream ran gently tinkling over its pebbly bed, and the tall
prairie grasses flowed up to the lost little hut as if they would
engulf it like a sea.</p>
<p>On every side of the deep valley&mdash;for I forgot to say the
hut stood in a valley&mdash;towered hills with great, flat, rocky
sides.&nbsp; On some of them the Indian tribes had scratched rude
pictures, records of their race.</p>
<p>In one of them&mdash;I remember it just as if now it was
before my eyes&mdash;an Indian chief, surrounded by his friends,
was setting free his <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>favourite horse upon the prairies,
either before his death or in reward of faithful services.&nbsp;
The little group of men cut in the stone, most probably with an
obsidian arrow-head, was life-like, though drawn without
perspective, which gave those figures of a vanished race an air
of standing in the clouds.</p>
<p>The chief stood with his bridle in his hand, his feather
war-bonnet upon his head, naked except the breech-clout.&nbsp;
His bow was slung across his shoulders and his quiver hung below
his arm, and with the other hand he kept the sun off from his
face as he gazed upon his horse.&nbsp; All kinds of hunting
scenes were there displayed, and others, such as the burial of a
chief, a dance, and other ceremonials, no doubt as dear to those
who drew them as are the rites in a cathedral to other
faithful.&nbsp; The flat rock bore one more inscription, stating
that Eusebio Leal passed by bearing despatches, and the date,
June the fifteenth, of the year 1687.&nbsp; But to return again
to the lone wickey-up.</p>
<p>We all sat looking at it: Eustaquio Gomez, <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>Polibio Medina,
Exaltacion Garcia, the Texan, two Pueblo Indians, and I who write
these lines.</p>
<p>Somehow it had an eerie look about it, standing so desolate,
out in those flowery wilds.</p>
<p>Inside it lay the body of a man, with the skin dry as
parchment, and his arms beside him, a Winchester, a bow and
arrows, and a lance.&nbsp; Eustaquio, taking up an arrow, after
looking at it, said that the dead man was an Apache of the
Mescalero band, and then, looking upon the ground and pointing
out some marks, said, &ldquo;He had let loose his horse before he
died, just as the chief did in the picture-writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was his epitaph, for how death overtook him none of us
could conjecture; but I liked the manner of his going off the
stage.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis meet and fitting to set free the horse or pen
before death overtakes you, or before the gentle public turns its
thumbs down and yells, &ldquo;Away with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Lamb, when some one asked him <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>something of
his works, answered that they were to be found in the South Sea
House, and that they numbered forty volumes, for he had laboured
many years there, making his bricks with the least possible
modicum of straw,&mdash;just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Mine, if you ask me, are to be found but in the trails I left
in all the years I galloped both on the prairies and the pampas
of America.</p>
<p>Hold it not up to me for egotism, O gentle reader, for I would
have you know that hardly any of the horses that I rode had shoes
on them, and thus the tracks are faint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Vale</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I<br />
BROUGHT FORWARD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> workshop in Parkhead was not
inspiriting.&nbsp; From one week&rsquo;s end to another, all
throughout the year, life was the same, almost without an
incident.&nbsp; In the long days of the Scotch summer the men
walked cheerily to work, carrying their dinner in a little
tin.&nbsp; In the dark winter mornings they tramped in the black
fog, coughing and spitting, through the black mud of Glasgow
streets, each with a woollen comforter, looking like a stocking,
round his neck.</p>
<p>Outside the dreary quarter of the town, its rows of dingy,
smoke-grimed streets and the mean houses, the one outstanding
feature was Parkhead Forge, with its tall chimneys belching smoke
into the air all day, and flames by night.&nbsp; Its glowing
furnaces, its giant hammers, its <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>little railway trucks in which men ran
the blocks of white-hot iron which poured in streams out of the
furnaces, flamed like the mouth of hell.</p>
<p>Inside the workshop the dusty atmosphere made a stranger cough
on entering the door.&nbsp; The benches with the rows of aproned
men all bending at their work, not standing upright, with their
bare, hairy chests exposed, after the fashion of the Vulcans at
the neighbouring forge, gave a half-air of domesticity to the
close, stuffy room.</p>
<p>A semi-sedentary life quickened their intellect; for where men
work together they are bound to talk about the topics of the day,
especially in Scotland, where every man is a born politician and
a controversialist.&nbsp; At meal-times, when they ate their
&ldquo;piece&rdquo; and drank their tea that they had carried
with them in tin flasks, each one was certain to draw out a
newspaper from the pocket of his coat, and, after studying it
from the Births, Deaths, and Marriages, down to the
editor&rsquo;s address on the last page, fall a-disputing upon
politics.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man, a gran&rsquo; speech by Bonar Law
aboot Home Rule.&nbsp; They Irish, set them up, what <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>do they make
siccan a din aboot?&nbsp; Ca&rsquo; ye it Home Rule?&nbsp; I
juist ca&rsquo; it Rome Rule.&nbsp; A miserable, priest-ridden
crew, the hale rick-ma-tick o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader then would pause and, looking round the shop, wait
for the answer that he was sure would not be long in coming from
amongst such a thrawn lot of commentators.&nbsp; Usually one or
other of his mates would fold his paper up, or perhaps point with
an oil-stained finger to an article, and with the head-break in
the voice, characteristic of the Scot about to plunge into an
argument, ejaculate: &ldquo;Bonar Law, ou aye, I kent him when he
was leader of the South Side Parliament.&nbsp; He always was a
dreary body, sort o&rsquo; dreich like; no that I&rsquo;m saying
the man is pairfectly illiterate, as some are on his side
o&rsquo; the Hoose there in Westminister.&nbsp; I read his
speech&mdash;the body is na blate, sort o&rsquo; quick at
figures, but does na take the pains to verify.&nbsp; Verification
is the soul of mathematics.&nbsp; Bonar Law, eh!&nbsp; Did ye see
how Maister Asquith trippit him handily in his tabulated figures
on the jute business under Free Trade, showing that all he had
advanced about protective tariffs and <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the drawback system was fair
redeeklous . . . as well as several errors in the total
sum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then others would cut in and words be bandied to and fro,
impugning the good faith and honour of every section of the House
of Commons, who, by the showing of their own speeches, were held
to be dishonourable rogues aiming at power and place, without a
thought for anything but their own ends.</p>
<p>This charitable view of men and of affairs did not prevent any
of the disputants from firing up if his own party was impugned;
for in their heart of hearts the general denunciation was but a
covert from which to attack the other side.</p>
<p>In such an ambient the war was sure to be discussed; some held
the German Emperor was mad&mdash;&ldquo;a daft-like thing to
challenge the whole world, ye see; maist inconsiderate, and shows
that the man&rsquo;s intellect is no weel balanced . . .
philosophy is whiles sort of unsettlin&rsquo; . . . the
felly&rsquo;s mad, ye ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others saw method in his madness, and alleged that it was
envy, &ldquo;naething but sheer envy that had brought on this
tramplin&rsquo; upon natural rights, but for all that he may be
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>thought to
get his own again, with they indemnities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who had studied economics &ldquo;were of opinion that
his reasoning was wrong, built on false premises, for there can
never be a royal road to wealth.&nbsp; Labour, ye see, is the
sole creative element of riches.&rdquo;&nbsp; At once a Tory
would rejoin, &ldquo;And brains.&nbsp; Man, what an awfu&rsquo;
thing to leave out brains.&nbsp; Think of the marvellous
creations of the human genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first would
answer with, &ldquo;I saw ye coming, man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll no
deny that brains have their due place in the economic state; but
build me one of your Zeppelins and stick it in the middle of
George Square without a crew to manage it, and how far will it
fly?&nbsp; I do not say that brains did not devise it; but, after
all, labour had to carry out the first design.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was a subject that opened up enormous vistas for discussion, and
for a time kept them from talking of the war.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Geordie, hammering away in one end of the room, took
little part in the debate.&nbsp; Good workmen both of them, and
friends, perhaps because of the difference of their temperaments,
for Jimmy was the type <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of red-haired, blue-eyed, tall, lithe
Scot, he of the <i>perfervidum ingenium</i>, and Geordie was a
thick-set, black-haired, dour and silent man.</p>
<p>Both of them read the war news, and Jimmy, when he read,
commented loudly, bringing down his fist upon the paper,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Weel done, Gordons!&rdquo; or &ldquo;That was
a richt gude charge upon the trenches by the
Sutherlands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Geordie would answer shortly,
&ldquo;Aye, no sae bad,&rdquo; and go on hammering.</p>
<p>One morning, after a reverse, Jimmy did not appear, and
Geordie sat alone working away as usual, but if possible more
dourly and more silently.&nbsp; Towards midday it began to be
whispered in the shop that Jimmy had enlisted, and men turned to
Geordie to ask if he knew anything about it, and the silent
workman, brushing the sweat off his brow with his coat-sleeve,
rejoined: &ldquo;Aye, ou aye, I went wi&rsquo; him yestreen to
the headquarters o&rsquo; the Camerons; he&rsquo;s joined the
kilties richt eneugh.&nbsp; Ye mind he was a sergeant in South
Africa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he bent over to his work and did not
join in the general conversation that ensued.</p>
<p>Days passed, and weeks, and his fellow-workmen, in the way men
will, occasionally <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>bantered Geordie, asking him if he was going to enlist,
and whether he did not think shame to let his friend go off alone
to fight.&nbsp; Geordie was silent under abuse and banter, as he
had always been under the injustices of life, and by degrees
withdrew into himself, and when he read his newspaper during the
dinner-hour made no remark, but folded it and put it quietly into
the pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>Weeks passed, weeks of suspense, of flaring headlines in the
Press, of noise of regiments passing down the streets, of
newsboys yelling hypothetic victories, and of the tension of the
nerves of men who know their country&rsquo;s destiny is hanging
in the scales.&nbsp; Rumours of losses, of defeats, of victories,
of checks and of advances, of naval battles, with hints of
dreadful slaughter filled the air.&nbsp; Women in black were seen
about, pale and with eyelids swollen with weeping, and people
scanned the reports of killed and wounded with dry throats and
hearts constricted as if they had been wrapped in whipcord, only
relaxing when after a second look they had assured themselves the
name they feared to see was absent from the list.</p>
<p>Long strings of Clydesdale horses ridden by <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>men in ragged
clothes, who sat them uneasily, as if they felt their situation
keenly, perched up in the public view, passed through the
streets.&nbsp; The massive caulkers on their shoes struck fire
occasionally upon the stones, and the great beasts, taught to
rely on man as on a god from the time they gambolled in the
fields, went to their doom unconsciously, the only mitigation of
their fate.&nbsp; Regiments of young recruits, some in plain
clothes and some in hastily-made uniforms, marched with as
martial an air as three weeks&rsquo; training gave them, to the
stations to entrain.&nbsp; Pale clerks, the elbows of their
jackets shiny with the slavery of the desk, strode beside men
whose hands were bent and scarred with gripping on the handles of
the plough in February gales or wielding sledges at the
forge.</p>
<p>All of them were young and resolute, and each was confident
that he at least would come back safe to tell the tale.&nbsp; Men
stopped and waved their hats, cheering their passage, and girls
and women stood with flushed cheeks and straining eyes as they
passed on for the first stage that took them towards the
front.&nbsp; Boys ran beside them, hatless and barefooted, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>shouting out
words that they had caught up on the drill-ground to the men, who
whistled as they marched a slow and grinding tune that sounded
like a hymn.</p>
<p>Traffic was drawn up close to the kerbstone, and from the top
of tram-cars and from carts men cheered, bringing a flush of
pride to many a pale cheek in the ranks.&nbsp; They passed on;
men resumed the business of their lives, few understanding that
the half-trained, pale-faced regiment that had vanished through
the great station gates had gone to make that business possible
and safe.</p>
<p>Then came a time of waiting for the news, of contradictory
paragraphs in newspapers, and then a telegram, the &ldquo;enemy
is giving ground on the left wing&rdquo;; and instantly a feeling
of relief that lightened every heart, as if its owner had been
fighting and had stopped to wipe his brow before he started to
pursue the flying enemy.</p>
<p>The workmen in the brassfitters&rsquo; shop came to their work
as usual on the day of the good news, and at the dinner-hour read
out the accounts of the great battle, clustering upon each
other&rsquo;s shoulders in their eagerness.&nbsp; At <a

turned to scan the list of casualties.&nbsp; Cameron, Campbell,
M&rsquo;Alister, Jardine, they read, as they ran down the list,
checking the names off with a match.&nbsp; The reader stopped,
and looked towards the corner where Geordie still sat working
silently.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned towards him, for the rest seemed to
divine even before they heard the name.&nbsp; &ldquo;Geordie man,
Jimmy&rsquo;s killed,&rdquo; the reader said, and as he spoke
Geordie laid down his hammer, and, reaching for his coat, said,
&ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s killed, is he?&nbsp; Well, some one&rsquo;s
got to account for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, opening the door, he walked out dourly, as if already he
felt the knapsack on his back and the avenging rifle in his
hand.</p>

LOS PINGOS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> amphitheatre of wood enclosed a
bay that ran so far into the land it seemed a lake.&nbsp; The
Uruguay flowed past, but the bay was so land-locked and so well
defended by an island lying at its mouth that the illusion was
complete, and the bay appeared to be cut off from all the
world.</p>
<p>Upon the river twice a day passed steamboats, which at
night-time gave an air as of a section of a town that floated
past the wilderness.&nbsp; Streams of electric light from every
cabin lit up the yellow, turgid river, and the notes of a band
occasionally floated across the water as the vessel passed.&nbsp;
Sometimes a searchlight falling on a herd of cattle, standing as
is their custom after nightfall upon a little hill, made them
stampede into the darkness, <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>dashing through brushwood or
floundering through a marsh, till they had placed themselves in
safety from this new terror of the night.</p>
<p>Above the bay the ruins of a great building stood.&nbsp; Built
scarcely fifty years ago, and now deserted, the ruins had taken
on an air as of a castle, and from the walls sprang plants,
whilst in the deserted courtyard a tree had grown, amongst whose
branches oven-birds had built their hanging nests of mud.&nbsp;
Cypresses towered above the primeval hard-wood, which grew all
gnarled and horny-looking, and nearly all had kept their Indian
names, as &ntilde;andubay, cha&ntilde;ar, tala and sarandi,
molle, and many another name as crabbed as the trunks which,
twisted and distorted, looked like the limbs of giants growing
from the ground.</p>
<p>Orange trees had run wild and shot up all unpruned, and apple
trees had reverted back to crabs.&nbsp; The trunks of all the
fruit-trees in the deserted garden round the ruined factory were
rubbed shiny by the cattle, for all the fences had long been
destroyed or fallen into decay.</p>
<p>A group of roofless workmen&rsquo;s cottages <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>gave an air
of desolation to the valley in which the factory and its
dependencies had stood.&nbsp; They too had been invaded by the
powerful sub-tropical plant life, and creepers covered with
bunches of bright flowers climbed up their walls.&nbsp; A
sluggish stream ran through the valley and joined the Uruguay,
making a little natural harbour.&nbsp; In it basked cat-fish, and
now and then from off the banks a tortoise dropped into the water
like a stone.&nbsp; Right in the middle of what once had been the
square grew a ceiba tree, covered with lilac flowers, hanging in
clusters like gigantic grapes.&nbsp; Here and there stood some
old omb&uacute;s, their dark metallic leaves affording an
impenetrable shade.&nbsp; Their gnarled and twisted roots, left
half-exposed by the fierce rains, gave an unearthly, prehistoric
look to them that chimed in well with the deserted air of the
whole place.&nbsp; It seemed that man for once had been subdued,
and that victorious nature had resumed her sway over a region
wherein he had endeavoured to intrude, and had been worsted in
the fight.</p>
<p>Nature had so resumed her sway that <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>buildings, planted trees, and paths
long overgrown with grass, seemed to have been decayed for
centuries, although scarce twenty years had passed since they had
been deserted and had fallen into decay.</p>
<p>They seemed to show the power of the recuperative force of the
primeval forest, and to call attention to the fact that man had
suffered a defeat.&nbsp; Only the grass in the deserted square
was still triumphant, and grew short and green, like an oasis in
the rough natural grasses that flowed nearly up to it, in the
clearings of the woods.</p>
<p>The triumph of the older forces of the world had been so final
and complete that on the ruins there had grown no moss, but
plants and bushes with great tufts of grass had sprung from them,
leaving the stones still fresh as when the houses were first
built.&nbsp; Nature in that part of the New World enters into no
compact with mankind, as she does over here in Europe to touch
his work kindly and almost with a reverent hand, and blend it
into something half compounded of herself.&nbsp; There bread is
bread and wine is wine, with no half-tints to make one body of
the whole.&nbsp; The one <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>remaining evidence of the aggression
of mankind, which still refused to bow the knee to the
overwhelming genius of the place, was a round bunch of eucalyptus
trees that stood up stark and unblushing, the colour of the
trunks and leaves so harshly different from all around them that
they looked almost vulgar, if such an epithet can be properly
applied to anything but man.&nbsp; Under their exiguous shade
were spread saddles and bridles, and on the ground sat men
smoking and talking, whilst their staked-out horses fed, fastened
to picket-pins by raw-hide ropes.&nbsp; So far away from
everything the place appeared that the group of men looked like a
band of pioneers upon some frontier, to which the ruins only gave
an air of melancholy, but did nothing to dispel the
loneliness.</p>
<p>As they sat idly talking, trying to pass, or, as they would
have said, trying to make time, suddenly in the distance the
whistle of an approaching steamer brought the outside world into
the little, lonely paradise.&nbsp; Oddly enough it sounded, in
the hot, early morning air, already heavy with the scent of the
mimosas in full bloom.&nbsp; Butterflies flitted to and fro <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>or soared
above the scrub, and now and then a wild mare whinnied from the
thickets, breaking the silence of the lone valley through which
the yellow, little stream ran to the Uruguay.</p>
<p>Catching their horses and rolling up the ropes, the men, who
had been sitting underneath the trees, mounted, and following a
little cattle trail, rode to a high bluff looking down the
stream.</p>
<p>Panting and puffing, as she belched out a column of black
smoke, some half a mile away, a tug towing two lighters strove
with the yellow flood.&nbsp; The horsemen stood like statues with
their horses&rsquo; heads stretched out above the water thirty
feet below.</p>
<p>Although the feet of several of the horses were but an inch or
two from the sheer limit, the men sat, some of them with one leg
on their horses&rsquo; necks; others lit cigarettes, and one,
with his horse sideways to the cliff, leaned sideways, so that
one of his feet was in the air.&nbsp; He pointed to the advancing
tug with a brown finger, and exclaimed, &ldquo;These are the
lighters with the horses that must have started yesterday from
Gualeguaych&uacute;, and ought to have been <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>here last
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; We had indeed been waiting all the night for
them, sleeping round a fire under the eucalyptus grove, and
rising often in the night to smoke and talk, to see our horses
did not get entangled in their stake ropes, and to listen for the
whistle of the tug.</p>
<p>The tug came on but slowly, fighting her way against the rapid
current, with the lighters towing behind her at some distance,
looking like portions of a pier that had somehow or another got
adrift.</p>
<p>From where we sat upon our horses we could see the surface of
the Uruguay for miles, with its innumerable flat islands buried
in vegetation, cutting the river into channels; for the islands,
having been formed originally by masses of water-weeds and
drift-wood, were but a foot or two above the water, and all were
elongated, forming great ribbons in the stream.</p>
<p>Upon the right bank stretched the green prairies of the State
of Entre-Rios, bounded on either side by the Uruguay and
Paran&aacute;.&nbsp; Much flatter than the land upon the
Uruguayan bank, it still was not a sea of level grass as is <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the State of
Buenos Aires, but undulating, and dotted here and there with
white estancia houses, all buried in great groves of peach trees
and of figs.&nbsp; On the left bank on which we stood, and three
leagues off, we could just see Fray Bentos, its houses dazzlingly
white, buried in vegetation, and in the distance like a thousand
little towns in Southern Italy and Spain, or even in Morocco, for
the tower of the church might in the distance just as well have
been a minaret.</p>
<p>The tug-boat slowed a little, and a canoe was slowly paddled
out to pilot her into the little haven made by the brook that
flowed down through the valley to the Uruguay.</p>
<p>Sticking out like a fishing-rod, over the stem of the canoe
was a long cane, to sound with if it was required.</p>
<p>The group of horsemen on the bluff rode slowly down towards
the river&rsquo;s edge to watch the evolutions of the tug, and to
hold back the horses when they should be disembarked.&nbsp; By
this time she had got so near that we could see the horses&rsquo;
heads looking out wildly from the sparred sides of the great
decked lighters, and hear the thunderous noise their <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>feet made
tramping on the decks.&nbsp; Passing the bay, into which ran the
stream, by about three hundred yards, the tug cast off one of the
lighters she was towing, in a backwater.&nbsp; There it remained,
the current slowly bearing it backwards, turning round upon
itself.&nbsp; In the wild landscape, with ourselves upon our
horses forming the only human element, the gigantic lighter with
its freight of horses looked like the ark, as set forth in some
old-fashioned book on Palestine.&nbsp; Slowly the tug crept in,
the Indian-looking pilot squatted in his canoe sounding
assiduously with his long cane.&nbsp; As the tug drew about six
feet of water and the lighter not much more than three, the
problem was to get the lighter near enough to the bank, so that
when the hawser was cast off she would come in by her own
way.&nbsp; Twice did the tug ground, and with furious shoutings
and with all the crew staving on poles, was she got off
again.&nbsp; At last the pilot found a little deeper channel, and
coming to about some fifty feet away, lying a length or two above
the spot where the stream entered the great river, she paid her
hawser out, and as the lighter drifted shorewards, cast it off,
and the great <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>ark, with all its freight, grounded quite gently on the
little sandy beach.&nbsp; The Italian captain of the tug, a
Genoese, with his grey hair as curly as the wool on a
sheep&rsquo;s back, wearing a pale pink shirt, neatly set off
with yellow horseshoes, and a blue gauze necktie tied in a
flowing bow, pushed off his dirty little boat, rowed by a negro
sailor and a Neapolitan, who dipped their oars into the water
without regard to one another, either as to time or stroke.</p>
<p>The captain stepped ashore, mopping his face with a yellow
pocket-handkerchief, and in the jargon between Spanish and
Italian that men of his sort all affect out in the River Plate,
saluted us, and cursed the river for its sandbanks and its turns,
and then having left it as accursed as the Styx or
Periphlegethon, he doubly cursed the Custom House, which, as he
said, was all composed of thieves, the sons of thieves, who would
be certainly begetters of the same.&nbsp; Then he calmed down a
little, and drawing out a long Virginia cigar, took out the straw
with seriousness and great dexterity, and then allowed about a
quarter of an inch of it to smoulder in a match, lighted it, and
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>sending
out a cloud of smoke, sat down upon the grass, and fell
a-cursing, with all the ingenuity of his profession and his race,
the country, the hot weather, and the saints.</p>
<p>This done, and having seen the current was slowly bearing down
the other lighter past the sandy beach, with a last hearty curse
upon God&rsquo;s mother and her Son, whose birth he hinted not
obscurely was of the nature of a mystery, in which he placed no
credence, got back into his boat, and went back to his tug,
leaving us all amazed, both at his fluency and faith.</p>
<p>When he had gone and grappled with the other lighter which was
slowly drifting down the stream, two or three men came forward in
the lighter that was already in the little river&rsquo;s mouth,
about a yard or so distant from the edge, and calling to us to be
ready, for the horses had not eaten for sixteen hours at least,
slowly let down the wooden landing-flap.&nbsp; At first the
horses craned their necks and looked out on the grass, but did
not venture to go down the wooden landing-stage; then a big roan,
stepping out gingerly and snorting as he <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>went,
adventured, and when he stood upon the grass, neighed shrilly and
then rolled.&nbsp; In a long string the others followed, the
clattering of their unshod feet upon the wood sounding like
distant thunder.</p>
<p>Byrne, the Porte&ntilde;o, stout and high-coloured, dressed in
great thigh boots and baggy breeches, a black silk handkerchief
tied loosely round his neck, a black felt hat upon his head, and
a great silver watch-chain, with a snaffle-bridle in the middle
of it, contrasting oddly with his broad pistol belt, with its old
silver dollars for a fastening, came ashore, carrying his saddle
on his back.&nbsp; Then followed Doherty, whose name, quite
unpronounceable to men of Latin race, was softened in their
speech to Duarte, making a good Castilian patronymic of it.&nbsp;
He too was a Porte&ntilde;o, <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a> although of Irish
stock.&nbsp; Tall, dark, and dressed in semi-native clothes, he
yet, like Byrne, always spoke Spanish when no foreigners were
present, and in his English that softening of the consonants and
broadening of the vowels was discernible that makes the speech of
men such as himself have <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>in it something, as it were,
caressing, strangely at variance with their character.&nbsp; Two
or three peons of the usual Gaucho type came after them, all
carrying saddles, and walking much as an alligator waddles on the
sand, or as the Medes whom Xenophon describes, mincing upon their
toes, in order not to blunt the rowels of their spurs.</p>
<p>Our men, Garcia the innkeeper of Fray Bentos, with Pablo
Suarez, whose negro blood and crispy hair gave him a look as of a
Roman emperor of the degenerate times, with Pancho Arrellano and
Miguel Paralelo, the Gaucho dandy, swaying upon his horse with
his toes just touching his heavy silver stirrups with a crown
underneath them, Velez and El Pampita, an Indian who had been
captured young on the south Pampa, were mounted ready to round
the horses up.</p>
<p>They did not want much care, for they were eating ravenously,
and all we had to do was to drive them a few hundred yards away
to let the others land.</p>
<p>By this time the Italian captain in his tug had gently brought
the other lighter to the beach, and from its side another string
of horses <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>came out on to the grass.&nbsp; They too all rolled,
and, seeing the other band, by degrees mixed with it, so that
four hundred horses soon were feeding ravenously on the sweet
grass just at the little river&rsquo;s mouth that lay between its
banks and the thick belt of wood.</p>
<p>Though it was early, still the sun was hot, and for an hour we
held the horses back, keeping them from the water till they had
eaten well.</p>
<p>The Italian tugmaster, having produced a bottle of trade gin
(the Anchor brand), and having drank our health, solemnly wiped
the neck of the bottle with his grimy hand and passed it round to
us.&nbsp; We also drank to his good health and voyage to the
port, that he pronounced as if it were written &ldquo;Bono
Airi,&rdquo; adding, as it was war-time, &ldquo;Avanti
Savoia&rdquo; to the toast.&nbsp; He grinned, and with a gesture
of his thick dirty hand, adorned with two or three
coppery-looking rings, as it were, embedded in the flesh,
pronounced an all-embracing curse on the Tedeschi, and went
aboard the tug.</p>
<p>When he had made the lighters fast, he turned down stream,
saluting us with three <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>shrill blasts upon the whistle, and
left us and our horses thousands of miles away from steam and
smoke, blaspheming skippers, and the noise and push of modern
life.</p>
<p>Humming-birds poised themselves before the purple bunches of
the ceiba <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> flowers, their tongues thrust into the
calyx and their iridescent wings whirring so rapidly, you could
see the motion, but not mark the movement, and from the yellow
balls of the mimosas came a scent, heady and comforting.</p>
<p>Flocks of green parroquets flew shrieking over the clearing in
which the horses fed, to their great nests, in which ten or a
dozen seemed to harbour, and hung suspended from them by their
claws, or crawled into the holes.&nbsp; Now and then a few
locusts, wafted by the breeze, passed by upon their way to spread
destruction in the plantations of young poplars and of orange
trees in the green islands in the stream.</p>
<p>An air of peace gave a strange interest to this little corner
of a world plunged into strife and woe.&nbsp; The herders nodded
on their <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>horses, who for their part hung down their heads, and
now and then shifted their quarters so as to bring their heads
into the shade.&nbsp; The innkeeper, Garcia, in his town clothes,
and perched upon a tall grey horse, to use his own words,
&ldquo;sweated blood and water like our Lord&rdquo; in the fierce
glare of the ascending sun.&nbsp; Suarez and Paralelo pushed the
ends of the red silk handkerchiefs they wore tied loosely round
their necks, with two points like the wings of a great butterfly
hanging upon their shoulders, under their hats, and smoked
innumerable cigarettes, the frontiersman&rsquo;s specific against
heat or cold.&nbsp; Of all the little company only the Pampa
Indian showed no sign of being incommoded by the heat.&nbsp; When
horses strayed he galloped up to turn them, now striking at the
passing butterflies with his heavy-handled whip, or, letting
himself fall down from the saddle almost to the ground, drew his
brown finger on the dust for a few yards, and with a wriggle like
a snake got back into his saddle with a yell.</p>
<p>The hours passed slowly, till at last the horses, having
filled themselves with grass, stopped eating and looked towards
the river, <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>so we allowed them slowly to stream along towards a
shallow inlet on the beach.&nbsp; There they stood drinking
greedily, up to their knees, until at last three or four of the
outermost began to swim.</p>
<p>Only their heads appeared above the water, and occasionally
their backs emerging just as a porpoise comes to the surface in a
tideway, gave them an amphibious air, that linked them somehow or
another with the classics in that unclassic land.</p>
<p>Long did they swim and play, and then, coming out into the
shallow water, drink again, stamping their feet and swishing
their long tails, rise up and strike at one another with their
feet.</p>
<p>As I sat on my horse upon a little knoll, coiling my lazo,
which had got uncoiled by catching in a bush, I heard a voice in
the soft, drawling accents of the inhabitants of Corrientes, say,
&ldquo;Pucha, Pingos.&rdquo; <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>Turning, I saw the speaker, a Gaucho of about thirty years of
age, dressed all in black in the old style of thirty years
ago.&nbsp; His silver <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>knife, two feet or more in length,
stuck in his sash, stuck out on both sides of his body like a
lateen.</p>
<p>Where he had come from I had no idea, for he appeared to have
risen from the scrub behind me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Puta, Pingos,&rdquo; giving the phrase in the more
classic, if more unregenerate style, &ldquo;how well they look,
just like the garden in the plaza at Fray Bentos in the
sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All shades were there, with every variegation and variety of
colour, white, and fern noses, chestnuts with a stocking on one
leg up to the stifle joint, horses with a ring of white right
round their throats, or with a star as clear as if it had been
painted on the hip, and &ldquo;tuvianos,&rdquo; that is, brown,
black, and white, a colour justly prized in Uruguay.</p>
<p>Turning half round and offering me a cigarette, the Correntino
spoke again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a paradise for all those pingos
here in this rinc&oacute;n: <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> grass, water,
everything that they can want, shade, and shelter from the wind
and sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it appeared to me&mdash;the swiftly flowing <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>river with
its green islands; the Pampas grass along the stream; the ruined
buildings, half-buried in the orange trees run wild; grass,
shade, and water: &ldquo;Pucha, no . . .&nbsp; Puta, Pingos,
where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>III<br
/>
FIDELITY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> tall host knocked the ashes from
his pipe, and crossing one leg over the other looked into the
fire.</p>
<p>Outside, the wind howled in the trees, and the rain beat upon
the window-panes.&nbsp; The firelight flickered on the grate,
falling upon the polished furniture of the low-roofed,
old-fashioned library, with its high Georgian overmantel, where
in a deep recess there stood a clock, shaped like a cross, with
eighteenth-century cupids carved in ivory fluttering round the
base, and Time with a long scythe standing upon one side.</p>
<p>In the room hung the scent of an old country-house, compounded
of so many samples that it is difficult to enumerate them
all.&nbsp; Beeswax and potpourri of roses, damp, and <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the scent of
foreign woods in the old cabinets, tobacco and wood smoke, with
the all-pervading smell of age, were some of them.&nbsp; The
result was not unpleasant, and seemed the complement of the
well-bound Georgian books standing demure upon their shelves, the
blackening family portraits, and the skins of red deer and of roe
scattered about the room.</p>
<p>The conversation languished, and we both sat listening to the
storm that seemed to fill the world with noises strange and
unearthly, for the house was far from railways, and the avenues
that lead to it were long and dark.&nbsp; The solitude and the
wild night seemed to have recreated the old world, long lost, and
changed, but still remembered in that district just where the
Highlands and the Lowlands meet.</p>
<p>At such times and in such houses the country really seems
country once again, and not the gardened, game-keepered mixture
of shooting ground and of fat fields tilled by machinery to which
men now and then resort for sport, or to gather in their rents,
with which the whole world is familiar to-day.</p>
<p>My host seemed to be struggling with himself to tell me
something, and as I looked <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>at him, tall, strong, and upright,
his face all mottled by the weather, his homespun coat, patched
on the shoulders with buckskin that once had been white, but now
was fawn-coloured with wet and from the chafing of his gun, I
felt the parturition of his speech would probably cost him a
shrewd throe.&nbsp; So I said nothing, and he, after having
filled his pipe, ramming the tobacco down with an old silver
Indian seal, made as he told me in Kurachi, and brought home by a
great-uncle fifty years ago, slowly began to speak, not looking
at me, but as it were delivering his thoughts aloud, almost
unconsciously, looking now and then at me as if he felt, rather
than knew, that I was there.&nbsp; As he spoke, the tall, stuffed
hen-harrier; the little Neapolitan shrine in tortoiseshell and
coral, set thick with saints; the flying dragons from Ceylon,
spread out like butterflies in a glazed case; the
&ldquo;poor&rsquo;s-box&rdquo; on the shelf above the books with
its four silver sides adorned with texts; the rows of blue books,
and of Scott&rsquo;s Novels (the Roxburgh edition), together with
the scent exuding from the Kingwood cabinet; the sprays of white
Scotch rose, outlined against the window blinds; and <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>the sporting
prints and family tree, all neatly framed in oak, created the
impression of being in a world remote, besquired and cut off from
the century in which we live by more than fifty years.&nbsp; Upon
the rug before the fire the sleeping spaniel whined uneasily, as
if, though sleeping, it still scented game, and all the time the
storm roared in the trees and whistled down the passages of the
lone country house.&nbsp; One saw in fancy, deep in the recesses
of the woods, the roe stand sheltering, and the capercailzie
sitting on the branches of the firs, wet and dejected, like
chickens on a roost, and little birds sent fluttering along,
battling for life against the storm.&nbsp; Upon such nights, in
districts such as that in which the gaunt old house was situated,
there is a feeling of compassion for the wild things in the woods
that, stealing over one, bridges the gulf between them and
ourselves in a mysterious way.&nbsp; Their lot and sufferings,
joys, loves, and the epitome of their brief lives, come home to
us with something irresistible, making us feel that our
superiority is an unreal thing, and that in essentials we are
one.</p>
<p>My host went on: &ldquo;Some time ago I <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>walked up to
the little moor that overlooks the Clyde, from which you see
ships far off lying at the Tail of the Bank, the smoke of
Greenock and Port Glasgow, the estuary itself, though miles away,
looking like a sheet of frosted silver or dark-grey steel,
according to the season, and in the distance the range of hills
called Argyle&rsquo;s Bowling Green, with the deep gap that marks
the entrance to the Holy Loch.&nbsp; Autumn had just begun to
tinge the trees, birches were golden, and rowans red, the bents
were brown and dry.&nbsp; A few bog asphodels still showed
amongst the heather, and bilberries, dark as black currants, grew
here and there amongst the carpet of green sphagnum and the
stag&rsquo;s-head moss.&nbsp; The heather was all rusty brown,
but still there was, as it were, a recollection of the summer in
the air.&nbsp; Just the kind of day you feel inclined to sit down
on the lee side of a dry-stone dyke, and smoke and look at some
familiar self-sown birch that marks the flight of time, as you
remember that it was but a year or two ago that it had first shot
up above the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember two or three plants of tall hemp-agrimony
still had their flower heads <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>withered on the stalk, giving them a
look of wearing wigs, and clumps of ragwort still had a few bees
buzzing about them, rather faintly, with a belated air.&nbsp; I
saw all this&mdash;not that I am a botanist, for you know I can
hardly tell the difference between the Crucifer&aelig; and the
Umbellifer&aelig;, but because when you live in the country some
of the common plants seem to obtrude themselves upon you, and you
have got to notice them in spite of you.&nbsp; So I walked on
till I came to a wrecked plantation of spruce and of Scotch
fir.&nbsp; A hurricane had struck it, turning it over almost in
rows, as it was planted.&nbsp; The trees had withered in most
cases, and in the open spaces round their upturned roots hundreds
of rabbits burrowed, and had marked the adjoining field with
little paths, just like the lines outside a railway-station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw all this, not because I looked at it, for if you
look with the idea of seeing everything, commonly everything
escapes you, but because the lovely afternoon induced a feeling
of well-being and contentment, and everything seemed to fall into
its right proportion, so that you saw first the harmonious whole,
and <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>then
the salient points most worth the looking at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked along feeling exhilarated with the autumn air
and the fresh breeze that blew up from the Clyde.&nbsp; I
remember thinking I had hardly ever felt greater content, and as
I walked it seemed impossible the world could be so full of rank
injustice, or that the lot of three-fourths of its population
could really be so hard.&nbsp; A pack of grouse flew past,
skimming above the heather, as a shoal of flying-fish skims just
above the waves.&nbsp; I heard their quacking cries as they
alighted on some stooks of oats, and noticed that the last bird
to settle was an old hen, and that, even when all were down, I
still could see her head, looking out warily above the yellow
grain.&nbsp; Beyond the ruined wood there came the barking of a
shepherd&rsquo;s dog, faint and subdued, and almost musical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat so long, smoking and looking at the view, that
when I turned to go the sun was sinking and our long, northern
twilight almost setting in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it,&rdquo; said my host, and I, who often had
read by its light in summer and the <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>early autumn, nodded assent,
wondering to myself what he was going to tell me, and he went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has the property of making all things look a little
ghostly, deepening the shadows and altering their values, so that
all that you see seems to acquire an extra significance, not so
much to the eye as to the mind.&nbsp; Slowly I retraced my steps,
walking under the high wall of rough piled stones till it ends,
at the copse of willows, on the north side of the little moor to
which I had seen the pack of grouse fly after it had left the
stooks.&nbsp; I crossed into it, and began to walk towards home,
knee-deep in bent grass and dwarf willows, with here and there a
patch of heather and a patch of bilberries.&nbsp; The softness of
the ground so dulled my footsteps that I appeared to walk as
lightly as a roe upon the spongy surface of the moor.&nbsp; As I
passed through a slight depression in which the grass grew
rankly, I heard a wild cry coming, as it seemed, from just
beneath my feet.&nbsp; Then came a rustling in the grass, and a
large, dark-grey bird sprang out, repeating the wild cry, and ran
off swiftly, trailing a broken wing.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;It paused upon a little hillock fifty yards away,
repeating its strange note, and looking round as if it sought for
something that it was certain was at hand.&nbsp; High in the air
the cry, wilder and shriller, was repeated, and a great grey bird
that I saw was a whaup slowly descended in decreasing circles,
and settled down beside its mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seemed to talk, and then the wounded bird set off
at a swift run, its fellow circling above its head and uttering
its cry as if it guided it.&nbsp; I watched them disappear,
feeling as if an iron belt was drawn tight round my heart, their
cries growing fainter as the deepening shadows slowly closed upon
the moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My host stopped, knocked the ashes from his pipe, and turning
to me, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched them go to what of course must have been
certain death for one of them, furious, with the feelings of a
murderer towards the man whose thoughtless folly had been the
cause of so much misery.&nbsp; Curse him!&nbsp; I watched them,
impotent to help, for as you know the curlew is perhaps the
wildest of our native birds; and even had I caught the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>wounded one
to set its wing, it would have pined and died.&nbsp; One thing I
could have done, had I but had a gun and had the light been
better, I might have shot them both, and had I done so I would
have buried them beside each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had upon my mind to tell you.&nbsp;
I think the storm and the wild noises of the struggling trees
outside have brought it back to me, although it happened years
ago.&nbsp; Sometimes, when people talk about fidelity, saying it
is not to be found upon the earth, I smile, for I have seen it
with my own eyes, and manifest, out on that little
moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He filled his pipe, and sitting down in an old leather chair,
much worn and rather greasy, silently gazed into the fire.</p>
<p>I, too, was silent, thinking upon the tragedy; then feeling
that something was expected of me, looked up and murmured,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>IV<br
/>
&ldquo;UNO DEI MILLE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">veil</span> of mist, the colour of a
spider&rsquo;s web, rose from the oily river.&nbsp; It met the
mist that wrapped the palm-trees and the unsubstantial-looking
houses painted in light blue and yellow ochre, as it descended
from the hills.&nbsp; Now and then, through the pall of damp, as
a light air was wafted up the river from the sea, the bright red
earth upon the hills showed like a stain of blood; canoes,
paddled by men who stood up, balancing themselves with a slight
movement of the hips, slipped in and out of sight, now crossing
just before the steamer&rsquo;s bows and then appearing
underneath her stern in a mysterious way.&nbsp; From the long
line of tin-roofed sheds a ceaseless stream of
snuff-and-butter-coloured men trotted continuously, carrying bags
of coffee to an elevator, which <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>shot them headlong down the
steamer&rsquo;s hold.&nbsp; Their naked feet pattered upon the
warm, wet concrete of the dock side, as it were stealthily, with
a sound almost alarming, so like their footfall seemed to that of
a wild animal.</p>
<p>The flat-roofed city, buried in sheets of rain, that spouted
from the eaves of the low houses on the unwary passers-by, was
stirred unwontedly.&nbsp; Men, who as a general rule lounged at
the corners of the streets, pressing their shoulders up against
the houses as if they thought that only by their own
self-sacrifice the walls were kept from falling, now walked up
and down, regardless of the rain.</p>
<p>In the great oblong square, planted with cocoa-palms, in which
the statue of Cabr&aacute;l stands up in cheap Carrara marble,
looking as if he felt ashamed of his discovery, a sea of wet
umbrellas surged to and fro, forging towards the Italian
Consulate.&nbsp; Squat Genoese and swarthy Neapolitans, with
sinewy Piedmontese, and men from every province of the peninsula,
all had left their work.&nbsp; They all discoursed in the same
tone of voice in which no doubt their ancestors talked in the
Forum, even when Cicero was speaking, until the <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>lictors
forced them to keep silence, for their own eloquence is that
which in all ages has had most charm for them.&nbsp; The reedy
voices of the Brazilian coloured men sounded a mere twittering
compared to their full-bodied tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Viva
l&rsquo;Italia&rdquo; pealed out from thousands of strong throats
as the crowd streamed from the square and filled the narrow
streets; fireworks that fizzled miserably were shot off in the
mist, the sticks falling upon the umbrellas of the crowd.&nbsp; A
shift of wind cleared the mist off the river for a moment,
leaving an Italian liner full in view.&nbsp; From all her spars
floated the red and white and green, and on her decks and in the
rigging, on bridges and on the rail, men, all with bundles in
their hands, clustered like ants, and cheered incessantly.&nbsp;
An answering cheer rose from the crowd ashore of &ldquo;Long live
the Reservists!&nbsp; Viva l&rsquo;Italia,&rdquo; as the vessel
slowly swung into the stream.&nbsp; From every house excited men
rushed out and flung themselves and their belongings into boats,
and scrambled up the vessel&rsquo;s sides as she began to
move.&nbsp; Brown hands were stretched down to them as they
climbed on board.&nbsp; From every doorstep in the town women
with <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>handkerchiefs about their heads came out, and with the
tears falling from their great, black eyes and running down their
olive cheeks, waved and called out, &ldquo;Addio Giuseppe; addio
Gian Battista, abbasso gli Tedeschi,&rdquo; and then turned back
into their homes to weep.&nbsp; On every side Italians stood and
shouted, and still, from railway station and from the river-side,
hundreds poured out and gazed at the departing steamer with its
teeming freight of men.</p>
<p>Italians from the coffee plantations of S&atilde;o Paulo, from
the mines of Ouro Preto, from Goyaz, and from the far interior,
all young and sun-burnt, the flower of those Italian workmen who
have built the railways of Brazil, and by whose work the strong
foundations of the prosperity of the Republic have been laid,
were out, to turn their backs upon the land in which, for the
first time, most of them had eaten a full meal.&nbsp; Factories
stood idle, the coasting schooners all were left unmanned, and
had the coffee harvest not been gathered in, it would have rotted
on the hills.&nbsp; The Consulate was unapproachable, and round
it throngs of men struggled to enter, all demanding to get
home.&nbsp; No rain could damp their <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>spirits, and those who, after waiting
hours, came out with tickets, had a look in their eyes as if they
just had won the chief prize in the lottery.</p>
<p>Their friends surrounded them, and strained them to their
hearts, the water from the umbrellas of the crowd trickling in
rivulets upon the embracer and the embraced.</p>
<p>Mulatto policemen cleared the path for carriages to pass, and,
as they came, the gap filled up again as if by magic, till the
next carriage passed.&nbsp; Suddenly a tremor ran through the
crowd, moving it with a shiver like the body of a snake.&nbsp;
All the umbrellas which had seemed to move by their own will,
covering the crowd and hiding it from view, were shut down
suddenly.&nbsp; A mist-dimmed sun shone out, watery, but potent,
and in an instant gaining strength, it dried the streets and made
a hot steam rise up from the crowd.&nbsp; Slouched hats were
raised up on one side, and pocket handkerchiefs wrapped up in
paper were unfolded and knotted loosely round men&rsquo;s necks,
giving them a look as of domestic bandits as they broke out into
a patriotic song, which ceased with a long drawn-out
&ldquo;Viva,&rdquo; <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>as the strains of an approaching band were heard and the
footsteps of men marching through the streets in military
array.</p>
<p>The coloured policemen rode their horses through the throng,
and the streets, which till then had seemed impassable, were
suddenly left clear.&nbsp; Jangling and crashing out the
Garibaldian hymn, the band debouched into the square, dressed in
a uniform half-German, half-Brazilian, with truncated
pickel-hauben on their heads, in which were stuck a plume of
gaudy feathers, apparently at the discretion of the wearer,
making them look like something in a comic opera; a tall mulatto,
playing on a drum with all the seriousness that only one of his
colour and his race is able to impart to futile actions,
swaggered along beside a jet-black negro playing on the
flute.&nbsp; All the executants wore brass-handled swords of a
kind never seen in Europe for a hundred years.&nbsp; Those who
played the trombone and the ophicleide blew till their thick lips
swelled, and seemed to cover up the mouthpieces.&nbsp; Still they
blew on, the perspiration rolling down their cheeks, and a black
boy or two brought up the rear, clashing the cymbals when it
seemed good to <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>them, quite irrespective of the rest.&nbsp; The noise
was terrifying, and had it not been for the enthusiasm of the
crowd, the motley band of coloured men, arrayed like popinjays,
would have been ridiculous; but the dense ranks of hot,
perspiring men, all in the flower of youth, and every one of whom
had given up his work to cross the ocean at his country&rsquo;s
call, had something in them that turned laughter into
tears.&nbsp; The sons of peasants, who had left their homes,
driven out from Apulean plains or Lombard rice-fields by the
pinch of poverty, they now were going back to shed their blood
for the land that had denied them bread in their own homes.&nbsp;
Twice did the band march round the town whilst the procession was
getting ready for a start, and each time that it passed before
the Consulate, the Consul came out on the steps, bare-headed, and
saluted with the flag.</p>
<p>Dressed in white drill, tall, grey-haired, and with the
washed-out look of one who has spent many years in a hot country,
the Consul evidently had been a soldier in his youth.&nbsp; He
stood and watched the people critically, with the appraising look
of the old officer, so like <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>to that a grazier puts on at a cattle
market as he surveys the beasts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good stuff,&rdquo;
he muttered to himself, and then drawing his hand across his
eyes, as if he felt where most of the &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo;
would lie in a few months, he went back to the house.</p>
<p>A cheer at the far corner of the square showed that the ranks
were formed.&nbsp; A policeman on a scraggy horse, with a great
rusty sabre banging at its side, rode slowly down the streets to
clear the way, and once again the parti-coloured band passed by,
playing the Garibaldian hymn.&nbsp; Rank upon rank of men tramped
after it, their friends running beside them for a last embrace,
and women rushing up with children for a farewell kiss.&nbsp;
Their merry faces set with determination, and their shoulders
well thrown back, three or four hundred men briskly stepped
along, trying to imitate the way the Bersaglieri march in
Italy.&nbsp; A shout went up of &ldquo;Long live the
Reservists,&rdquo; as a contingent, drawn from every class of the
Italian colony, passed along the street.&nbsp; Dock-labourers and
pale-faced clerks in well-cut clothes and unsubstantial boots
walked side by side.&nbsp; Men burnt the colour <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of a brick by
working at the harvest rubbed shoulders with Sicilian emigrants
landed a month or two ago, but who now were going off to fight,
as poor as when they left their native land, and dressed in the
same clothes.&nbsp; Neapolitans, gesticulating as they marched,
and putting out their tongues at the Brazilian negroes, chattered
and joked.&nbsp; To them life was a farce, no matter that the
setting of the stage on which they moved was narrow, the fare
hard, and the remuneration small.&nbsp; If things were adverse
they still laughed on, and if the world was kind they jeered at
it and at themselves, disarming both the slings of fortune and
her more dangerous smiles with a grimace.</p>
<p>As they marched on, they now and then sketched out in
pantomime the fate of any German who might fall into their hands,
so vividly that shouts of laughter greeted them, which they
acknowledged by putting out their tongues.&nbsp;
Square-shouldered Liguresi succeeded them, with Lombards,
Sicilians, and men of the strange negroid-looking race from the
Basilicata, almost as dark-skinned as the Brazilian loungers at
the corners of the streets.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>They
all passed on, laughing, and quite oblivious of what was in store
for most of them&mdash;laughing and smoking, and, for the first
time in their lives, the centre of a show.&nbsp; After them came
another band; but this time of Italians, well-dressed, and
playing on well-cared-for instruments.&nbsp; Behind them walked a
little group of men, on whose appearance a hush fell on the
crowd.&nbsp; Two of them wore uniforms, and between them,
supported by silk handkerchiefs wrapped round his arms, there
walked a man who was welcomed with a scream of joy.&nbsp; Frail,
and with trembling footsteps, dressed in a faded old red shirt
and knotted handkerchief, his parchment cheeks lit up with a
faint flush as the Veteran of Marsala passed like a phantom of a
glorious past.&nbsp; With him appeared to march the rest of his
companions who set sail from Genoa to call into existence that
Italy for which the young men all around him were prepared to
sacrifice their lives.</p>
<p>To the excited crowd he typified all that their fathers had
endured to drive the stranger from their land.&nbsp; The two
Cairoli, Nino Bixio, and the heroic figure, wrapped in his
poncho, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>who rides in glory on the Janiculum, visible from every
point of Rome, seemed to march by the old man&rsquo;s side in the
imagination of the crowd.&nbsp; Women rushed forward, carrying
flowers, and strewed them on the scant grey locks of the old
soldier; and children danced in front of him, like little
Bacchanals.&nbsp; All hats were off as the old man was borne
along, a phantom of himself, a symbol of a heroic past, and still
a beacon, flickering but alight, to show the way towards the goal
which in his youth had seemed impossible to reach.</p>
<p>Slowly the procession rolled along, surging against the houses
as an incoming tide swirls up a river, till it reached the
Consulate.&nbsp; It halted, and the old Garibaldian, drawing
himself up, saluted the Italian colours.&nbsp; The Consul,
bare-headed and with tears running down his cheeks, stood for a
moment, the centre of all eyes, and then, advancing, tore the
flag from off its staff, and, after kissing it, wrapped it round
the frail shoulders of the veteran.</p>
<h2><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>V<br
/>
WITH THE NORTH-EAST WIND</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">north-east</span> haar had hung the city
with a pall of grey.&nbsp; It gave an air of hardness to the
stone-built houses, blending them with the stone-paved streets,
till you could scarce see where the houses ended and the street
began.&nbsp; A thin grey dust hung in the air.&nbsp; It coloured
everything, and people&rsquo;s faces all looked pinched with the
first touch of autumn cold.&nbsp; The wind, boisterous and gusty,
whisked the soot-grimed city leaves about in the high suburb at
the foot of a long range of hills, making one think it would be
easy to have done with life on such an uncongenial day.&nbsp;
Tramways were packed with people of the working class, all of
them of the alert, quick-witted type only to be seen in the great
city on the Clyde, in all our Empire, and comparable <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>alone to the
dwellers in Chicago for dry vivacity.</p>
<p>By the air they wore of chastened pleasure, all those who knew
them saw that they were intent upon a funeral.&nbsp; To
serious-minded men such as are they, for all their quickness,
nothing is so soul-filling, for it is of the nature of a fact
that no one can deny.&nbsp; A wedding has its possibilities, for
it may lead to children, or divorce, but funerals are in another
category.&nbsp; At them the Scottish people is at its best, for
never more than then does the deep underlying tenderness peep
through the hardness of the rind.&nbsp; On foot and in the
tramways, but most especially on foot, converged long lines of
men and women, though fewer women, for the national prejudice
that in years gone by thought it not decent for a wife to follow
to the grave her husband&rsquo;s coffin, still holds a little in
the north.&nbsp; Yet there was something in the crowd that showed
it was to attend no common funeral, that they were
&ldquo;stepping west.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one wore black, except a
minister or two, who looked a little like the belated rook you
sometimes see amongst a flock of seagulls, in that vast ocean of
grey tweed.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>They
tramped along, the whistling north-east wind pinching their
features, making their eyes run, and as they went, almost
unconsciously they fell into procession, for beyond the tramway
line, a country lane that had not quite put on the graces of a
street, though straggling houses were dotted here and there along
it, received the crowd and marshalled it, as it were
mechanically, without volition of its own.&nbsp; Kept in between
the walls, and blocked in front by the hearse and long procession
of the mourning-coaches, the people slowly surged along.&nbsp;
The greater portion of the crowd were townsmen, but there were
miners washed and in their Sunday best.&nbsp; Their faces showed
the blue marks of healed-up scars into which coal dust or
gunpowder had become tattooed, scars gained in the battle of
their lives down in the pits, remembrances of falls of rock or of
occasions when the mine had &ldquo;fired upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many had known Keir Hardie in his youth, had &ldquo;wrocht
wi&rsquo; him out-by,&rdquo; at Blantyre, at Hamilton, in
Ayrshire, and all of them had heard him speak a hundred
times.&nbsp; Even to those who had not heard him, his name was <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>as a
household word.&nbsp; Miners predominated, but men of every trade
were there.&nbsp; Many were members of that black-coated
proletariat, whose narrow circumstances and daily struggle for
appearances make their life harder to them than is the life of
any working man before he has had to dye his hair.&nbsp; Women
tramped, too, for the dead leader had been a champion of their
sex.&nbsp; They all respected him, loving him with that
half-contemptuous gratitude that women often show to men who make
the &ldquo;woman question&rdquo; the object of their lives.</p>
<p>After the Scottish fashion at a funeral, greetings were freely
passed, and Reid, who hadna&rsquo; seen his friend Mackinder
since the time of the Mid-Lanark fight, greeted him with
&ldquo;Ye mind when first Keir Hardie was puttin&rsquo; up for
Parliament,&rdquo; and wrung his hand, hardened in the mine, with
one as hardened, and instantly began to recall elections of the
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye mind yon Wishaw meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, ou aye; ye mean when a&rsquo; they Irish
wouldna&rsquo; hear John Ferguson.&nbsp; Man, he almost grat
after the meeting aboot it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;Aye, but they gied Hardie himself a maist
respectful hearing . . . aye, ou aye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others remembered him a boy, and others in his home at
Cumnock, but all spoke of him with affection, holding him as
something of their own, apart from other politicians, almost
apart from men.</p>
<p>Old comrades who had been with him either at this election or
that meeting, had helped or had intended to have helped at the
crises of his life, fought their old battles over, as they
tramped along, all shivering in the wind.</p>
<p>The procession reached a long dip in the road, and the head of
it, full half a mile away, could be seen gathered round the
hearse, outside the chapel of the crematorium, whose ominous tall
chimney, through which the ashes, and perchance the souls of
thousands have escaped towards some empyrean or another, towered
up starkly.&nbsp; At last all had arrived, and the small open
space was crowded, the hearse and carriages appearing stuck
amongst the people, like raisins in a cake, so thick they pressed
upon them.&nbsp; The chapel, differing from the ordinary chapel
of the faiths as much as does a motor driver from a cabman, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>had an air as
of modernity about it, which contrasted strangely with the
ordinary looking crowd, the adjacent hills, the decent mourning
coaches and the black-coated undertakers who bore the coffin up
the steps.&nbsp; Outside, the wind whistled and swayed the
soot-stained trees about; but inside the chapel the heat was
stifling.</p>
<p>When all was duly done, and long exordiums passed upon the man
who in his life had been the target for the abuse of press and
pulpit, the coffin slid away to its appointed place.&nbsp; One
thought one heard the roaring of the flames, and somehow missed
the familiar lowering of the body . . . earth to earth . . . to
which the centuries of use and wont have made us all familiar,
though dust to dust in this case was the more appropriate.</p>
<p>In either case, the book is closed for ever, and the familiar
face is seen no more.</p>
<p>So, standing just outside the chapel in the cold, waiting till
all the usual greetings had been exchanged, I fell a-musing on
the man whom I had known so well.&nbsp; I saw him as he was
thirty years ago, outlined against a bing or standing in a quarry
in some mining village, <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and heard his once familiar address
of &ldquo;Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; He used no other in those days, to
the immense disgust of legislators and other worthy but
unimaginative men whom he might chance to meet.&nbsp; About him
seemed to stand a shadowy band, most of whom now are dead or lost
to view, or have gone under in the fight.</p>
<p>John Ferguson was there, the old-time Irish leader, the friend
of Davitt and of Butt.&nbsp; Tall and erect he stood, dressed in
his long frock-coat, his roll of papers in one hand, and with the
other stuck into his breast, with all the air of being the last
Roman left alive.&nbsp; Tom Mann, with his black hair, his
flashing eyes, and his tumultuous speech peppered with
expletives.&nbsp; Beside him, Sandy Haddow, of Parkhead, massive
and Doric in his speech, with a grey woollen comforter rolled
round his neck, and hands like panels of a door.&nbsp; Champion,
pale, slight, and interesting, still the artillery officer, in
spite of Socialism.&nbsp; John Burns; and Small, the
miners&rsquo; agent, with his close brown beard and taste for
literature.&nbsp; Smillie stood near, he of the seven elections,
and then check-weigher at a pit, either at Cadzow or
Larkhall.&nbsp; There, too, was <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>silver-tongued Shaw Maxwell and
Chisholm Robertson, looking out darkly on the world through
tinted spectacles; with him Bruce Glasier, girt with a red sash
and with an aureole of fair curly hair around his head, half poet
and half revolutionary.</p>
<p>They were all young and ardent, and as I mused upon them and
their fate, and upon those of them who have gone down into the
oblivion that waits for those who live before their time, I
shivered in the wind.</p>
<p>Had he, too, lived in vain, he whose scant ashes were no doubt
by this time all collected in an urn, and did they really
represent all that remained of him?</p>
<p>Standing amongst the band of shadowy comrades I had known, I
saw him, simple and yet with something of the prophet in his air,
and something of the seer.&nbsp; Effective and yet ineffectual,
something there was about him that attracted little children to
him, and I should think lost dogs.&nbsp; He made mistakes, but
then those who make no mistakes seldom make anything.&nbsp; His
life was one long battle, so it seemed to me that it was fitting
that at his funeral the north-east wind should howl <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>amongst the
trees, tossing and twisting them as he himself was twisted and
storm-tossed in his tempestuous passage through the world.</p>
<p>As the crowd moved away, and in the hearse and
mourning-coaches the spavined horses limped slowly down the road,
a gleam of sunshine, such as had shone too little in his life,
lighted up everything.</p>
<p>The swaying trees and dark, grey houses of the ugly suburb of
the town were all transfigured for a moment.&nbsp; The chapel
door was closed, and from the chimney of the crematorium a faint
blue smoke was issuing, which, by degrees, faded into the
atmosphere, just as the soul, for all I know, may melt into the
air.</p>
<p>When the last stragglers had gone, and bits of paper scurried
uneasily along before the wind, the world seemed empty, with
nothing friendly in it, but the shoulder of Ben Lomond peeping
out shyly over the Kilpatrick Hills.</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>VI<br

ELYSIUM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Triad came into my life as I
walked underneath the arch by which the sentinels sit in Olympian
state upon their rather long-legged chargers, receiving, as is
their due, the silent homage of the passing nurserymaids. The
soldier in the middle was straight back from the front.&nbsp; The
mud of Flanders clung to his boots and clothes.&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;deeched&rdquo; into his skin, and round his eyes had left
a stain so dark, it looked as if he had been painted for a
theatrical make-up.&nbsp; Upon his puttees it had dried so
thickly that you could scarcely see the folds.&nbsp; He bore upon
his back his knapsack, carried his rifle in his hand all done up
in a case, which gave it, as it seemed to me, a look of hidden
power, making it more terrible to think of than if it had shone
brightly in the <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>sun.&nbsp; His water-bottle and a pack of some kind hung
at his sides, and as he walked kept time to every step.&nbsp;
Under his elbow protruded the shaft of something, perhaps an
entrenching tool of some sort, or perhaps some weapon strange to
civilians accustomed to the use of stick or umbrella as their
only arm.&nbsp; In himself he seemed a walking arsenal, carrying
his weapons and his baggage on his back, after the fashion of a
Roman legionary.&nbsp; The man himself, before the hand of
discipline had fashioned him to number something or another, must
have looked fresh and youthful, not very different from a
thousand others that in time of peace one sees in early morning
going to fulfil one of those avocations without which no State
can possibly endure, and yet are practically unknown to those who
live in the vast stucco hives either of Belgravia or Mayfair.</p>
<p>He may have been some five-and-twenty, and was a Londoner or a
man from the home counties lying round about.&nbsp; His sunburnt
face was yet not sunburnt as is the face of one accustomed to the
weather all his life.&nbsp; Recent exposure had made his skin all
feverish, <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>and his blue eyes were fixed, as often are the eyes of
sailors or frontiersmen after a long watch.</p>
<p>The girls on either side of him clung to his arm with pride,
and with an air of evident affection, that left them quite
unconscious of everything but having got the beloved object of
their care safe home again.&nbsp; Upon the right side, holding
fast to the warrior&rsquo;s arm, and now and then nestling close
to his side, walked his sweetheart, a dark-haired girl, dressed
in the miserable cheap finery our poorer countrywomen wear,
instead of well-made plainer clothes that certainly would cost
them less and set them off a hundredfold the more.&nbsp; Now and
again she pointed out some feature of the town with pride, as
when they climbed the steps under the column on which stands the
statue of the Duke of York.&nbsp; The soldier, without looking,
answered, &ldquo;I know, Ethel, Dook of York,&rdquo; and hitched
his pack a little higher on his back.</p>
<p>His sister, hanging on his left arm, never said anything, but
walked along as in a dream; and he, knowing that she was there
and understood, spoke little to her, except to murmur &ldquo;Good
old Gladys&rdquo; now and then, and press <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>her to his
side.&nbsp; As they passed by the stunted monument, on which the
crowd of little figures standing round a sledge commemorates the
Franklin Expedition, in a chill Arctic way, the girl upon the
right jerked her head towards it and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Sir John Franklin, George, he as laid down his life to find the
North-West Passage, one of our &rsquo;eroes, you remember
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he answered, &ldquo;Oh yes,
Frenklin&rdquo;; then looking over at the statue of Commander
Scott, added, &ldquo;&rsquo;ee done his bit too,&rdquo; with an
appreciative air.&nbsp; They gazed upon the Athen&aelig;um and
the other clubs with that air of detachment that all Englishmen
affect when they behold a building or a monument&mdash;taking it,
as it seems to me, as something they have no concern with, just
as if it stood in Petrograd or in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The homing triad passed into Pall Mall, oblivious of the
world, so lost in happiness that they appeared the only living
people in the street.&nbsp; The sister, who had said so little,
when she saw her brother shift his knapsack, asked him to let her
carry it.&nbsp; He smiled, and knowing what she felt, handed his
rifle to her, <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>remarking, &ldquo;&rsquo;Old it the right side up, old
girl, or else it will go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they took their way through the enchanted streets, not
feeling either the penetrating wind or the fine rain, for these
are but material things, and they were wrapped apart from the
whole world.&nbsp; Officers of all ranks passed by them, some
young and smart, and others paunchy and middle-aged; but they
were non-existent to the soldier, who saw nothing but the
girls.&nbsp; Most of the officers looked straight before them,
with an indulgent air; but two young men with red bands round
their caps were scandalised, and muttering something as to the
discipline of the New Army, drew themselves up stiffly and
strutted off, like angry game-cocks when they eye each other in
the ring.</p>
<p>The triad passed the Rag, and on the steps stood two old
colonels, their faces burnt the colour of a brick, and their
moustaches stiff as the bristles of a brush.&nbsp; They eyed the
passing little show, and looking at each other broke into a
smile.&nbsp; They knew that they would never walk oblivious of
mankind, linked to a woman&rsquo;s arm; but perhaps memories of
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>what they
had done stirred in their hearts, for both of them at the same
moment ejaculated a modulated &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; of
sympathy.&nbsp; All this time I had walked behind the three young
people, unconsciously, as I was going the same road, catching
half phrases now and then, which I was half ashamed to hear.</p>
<p>They reached the corner of St. James&rsquo;s Square, and our
paths separated.&nbsp; Mine took me to the London Library to
change a book, and theirs led straight to Elysium, for five long
days.</p>
<h2><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>VII<br
/>
HEREDITY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Right</span> along the frontier between
Uruguay and Rio Grande, the southern province of Brazil, the
Spanish and the Portuguese sit face to face, as they have sat for
ages, looking at, but never understanding, one another, both in
the Old and the New World.</p>
<p>In Tuy and Valenza, Monzon and Salvatierra, at Poncho Verde
and Don Pedrito, Rivera and Santa Ana do Libramento, and far away
above Cruz Alta, where the two clumps of wood that mark old camps
of the two people are called O Matto Castelhano and O Matto
Portuguez, the rivalry of centuries is either actual or at least
commemorated on the map.</p>
<p>The border-line that once made different peoples of the
dwellers at Floriston and <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Gretna, still prevails in the little
castellated towns, which snarl at one another across the Minho,
just as they did of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people in Valenza would steal the
sacrament,&rdquo; says the street urchin playing on the steps of
the half fortalice, half church that is the cathedral of Tuy on
the Spanish side.</p>
<p>His fellow in Valenza spits towards Tuy and remarks,
&ldquo;From Spain come neither good marriages nor the wholesome
winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So on to Salvatierra and Monzon, or any other of the villages
or towns upon the river, and in the current of the native speech
there still remains some saying of the kind, with its sharp edges
still unworn after six centuries of use.&nbsp; Great is the power
of artificial barriers to restrain mankind.&nbsp; No proverb ever
penned is more profound than that which sets out, &ldquo;Fear
guards the vineyard, not the fence around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Portuguese and Spaniards in their peninsula have fought and
hated and fought and ridiculed each other after the fashion of
children that have quarrelled over a broken toy.&nbsp; Blood and
an almost common speech, <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>for both speak one Romance when all
is said, have both been impotent against the custom-house, the
flag, the foolish dynasty, for few countries in the world have
had more foolish kings than Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>That this should be so in the Old World is natural enough, for
the dead hand still rules, and custom and tradition have more
strength than race and creed; but that the hatred should have
been transplanted to America, and still continue, is a proof that
folly never dies.</p>
<p>In the old towns on either side of the Minho the exterior life
of the two peoples is the same.</p>
<p>In the stone-built, arcaded plazas women still gather round
the fountain and fill their iron-hooped water-barrels through
long tin pipes, shaped like the tin valences used in
wine-stores.&nbsp; Donkeys stand at the doors, carrying charcoal
in esparto baskets, whether in Portugal or Spain, and goats
parade the streets driven by goatherds, wearing shapeless,
thickly-napped felt hats and leather overalls.</p>
<p>The water-carrier in both countries calls out
&ldquo;agua-a-a,&rdquo; making it sound like Arabic, <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and long
trains of mules bring brushwood for the baker&rsquo;s furnace
(even as in Morocco), or great nets of close-chopped straw for
horses&rsquo; fodder.</p>
<p>At eventide the girls walk on the plaza, their mothers, aunts,
or servants following them as closely as their shadows on a sunny
afternoon.&nbsp; In quiet streets lovers on both sides of the
river talk from a first-floor balcony to the street, or whisper
through the window-bars on the ground floor.&nbsp; The little
shops under the low arches of the arcaded streets have yellow
flannel drawers for men and petticoats of many colours hanging
close outside their doors, on whose steps sleep yellow dogs.</p>
<p>The jangling bells in the decaying lichen-grown old towers of
the churches jangle and clang in the same key, and as appears
without a touch of <i>odium theologicum</i>.&nbsp; The full bass
voices boom from the choirs, in which the self-same organs in
their walnut cases have the same rows of golden trumpets sticking
out into the aisle.</p>
<p>One faith, one speech, one mode of daily life, the same sharp
&ldquo;green&rdquo; wine, the same <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>bread made of maize and rye, and the
same heaps of red tomatoes and green peppers glistening in the
sun in the same market-places, and yet a rivalry and a difference
as far apart as east from west still separates them.</p>
<p>In both their countries the axles of the bullock-carts, with
solid wheels and wattled hurdle sides, like those upon a Roman
coin, still creak and whine to keep away the wolves.</p>
<p>In the soft landscape the maize fields wave in the rich
hollows on both sides of the Minho.</p>
<p>The pine woods mantle the rocky hills that overhang the
deep-sea lochs that burrow in both countries deep into the
entrails of the land.</p>
<p>The women, with their many-coloured petticoats and
handkerchiefs, chaffer at the same fairs to which their husbands
ride their ponies in their straw cloaks.</p>
<p>At &ldquo;romerias&rdquo; the peasantry dance to the bagpipe
and the drum the self-same dances, and both climb the self-same
steep grey steps through the dark lanes, all overhung with gorse
and broom, up to the Calvaries, where the three crosses take on
the self-same growth <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>of lichen and of moss.&nbsp; Yet the
&ldquo;boyero&rdquo; who walks before the placid oxen, with their
cream-coloured flanks and liquid eyes of onyx, feels he is
different, right down to the last molecule of his being, from the
man upon the other side.</p>
<p>So was it once, and perhaps is to-day, with those who dwell in
Liddes or Bewcastle dales.&nbsp; Spaniard and Portuguese, as Scot
and Englishman in older times, can never see one matter from the
same point of view.&nbsp; The Portuguese will say that the
Castilian is a rogue, and the Castilian returns the
compliment.&nbsp; Neither have any reason to support their view,
for who wants reason to support that which he feels is true.</p>
<p>It may be that the Spaniard is a little rougher and the
Portuguese more cunning; but if it is the case or not, the
antipathy remains, and has been taken to America.</p>
<p>From the Laguna de Merin to the Cuareim, that is to say, along
a frontier of two hundred leagues, the self-same feeling rules
upon both sides of the line.&nbsp; There, as in Portugal and
Spain, although the country, whether in Uruguay or in Brazil, is
little different, yet it <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>has suffered something indefinable by
being occupied by members of the two races so near and yet so
different from one another.</p>
<p>Great rolling seas of waving grass, broken by a few stony
hills, are the chief features of the landscape of the frontiers
in both republics.&nbsp; Estancia houses, dazzlingly white,
buried in peach and fig groves, dot the plains, looking like
islands in the sea of grass.&nbsp; Great herds of cattle roam
about, and men on horseback, galloping like clockwork, sail
across the plains like ships upon a sea.&nbsp; Along the
river-banks grow strips of thorny trees, and as the frontier line
trends northward palm-trees appear, and monkeys chatter in the
woods.&nbsp; Herds of wild asses, shyer than antelopes, gaze at
the passing horsemen, scour off when he approaches, and are lost
into the haze.&nbsp; Stretches of purple borage, known as La Flor
Morada, carpet the ground in spring and early summer, giving
place later on to red verbena; and on the edges of the streams
the tufts of the tall Pampa grass recall the feathers on a Pampa
Indian&rsquo;s spear.</p>
<p>Bands of grave ostriches feed quietly upon the tops of hills,
and stride away when <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>frightened, down the wind, with wings
stretched out to catch the breeze.</p>
<p>Clothes are identical, or almost so; the poncho and the loose
trousers stuffed into high patent-leather boots, the hat kept in
its place by a black ribbon with two tassels, are to be seen on
both sides of the frontier.&nbsp; Only in Brazil a sword stuck
through the girth replaces the long knife of Uruguay.&nbsp;
Perhaps in that one item all the differences between the races
manifests itself, for the sword is, as it were, a symbol, for no
one ever saw one drawn or used in any way but as an
ornament.&nbsp; It is, in fact, but a survival of old customs,
which are cherished both by the Portuguese and the Brazilians as
the apple of the eye.</p>
<p>The vast extent of the territory of Brazil, its
inaccessibility, and the enormous distances to be travelled from
the interior to the coast, and the sense of remoteness from the
outer world, have kept alive a type of man not to be found in any
other country where the Christian faith prevails.&nbsp; Risings
of fanatics still are frequent; one is going on to-day in
Paran&aacute;, and that of the celebrated Antonio <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Concelheiro,
twenty years ago, shook the whole country to its core.&nbsp;
Slavery existed in the memory of people still alive.&nbsp; Women
in the remoter towns are still secluded almost as with the
Moors.&nbsp; The men still retain something of the Middle Ages in
their love of show.&nbsp; All in the province of Rio Grande are
great horsemen, and all use silver trappings on a black horse,
and all have horses bitted so as to turn round in the air, just
as a hawk turns on the wing.</p>
<p>The sons of men who have been slaves abound in all the little
frontier towns, and old grey-headed negroes, who have been slaves
themselves, still hang about the great estates.&nbsp; Upon the
other side, in Uruguay, the negro question was solved once and
for all in the Independence Wars, for then the negroes were all
formed into battalions by themselves and set in the forefront of
the battle, to die for liberty in a country where they all were
slaves the month before.&nbsp; War turned them into heroes, and
sent them out to die.</p>
<p>When once their independence was assured, the Uruguayans fell
into line like magic with the modern trend of thought.&nbsp;
Liberty to <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>them meant absolute equality, for throughout the land no
snob is found to leave a slug&rsquo;s trail on the face of man by
his subserviency.</p>
<p>Women were held free, that is, as free as it is possible for
them to be in any Latin-peopled land.&nbsp; Across the line, even
to-day, a man may stay a week in a Brazilian country house and
never see a woman but a mulata girl or an old negro crone.&nbsp;
Still he feels he is watched by eyes he never sees, listens to
voices singing or laughing, and a sense of mystery prevails.</p>
<p>Spaniards and Portuguese in the New World have blended just as
little as they have done at home.&nbsp; Upon the frontier all the
wilder spirits of Brazil and Uruguay have congregated.&nbsp;
There they pursue the life, but little altered, that their
fathers led full fifty years ago.&nbsp; All carry arms, and use
them on small provocation, for if an accident takes place the
frontier shields the slayer, for to pursue him usually entails a
national quarrel, and so the game goes on.</p>
<p>So Jango Chaves, feeling inclined for sport, or, as he might
have said, to &ldquo;brincar un bocadinho,&rdquo; saddled up his
horse.&nbsp; He <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>mounted, and, as his friends were looking on, ran it
across the plaza of the town, and, turning like a seagull in its
flight, came back to where his friends were standing, and stopped
it with a jerk.</p>
<p>His silver harness jingled, and his heavy spurs, hanging
loosely on his high-heeled boots, clanked like fetters, as his
active little horse bounded into the air and threw the sand up in
a shower.</p>
<p>The rider, sitting him like a statue, with the far-off look
horsemen of every land assume when riding a good horse and when
they know they are observed, slackened his hand and let him fall
into a little measured trot, arching his neck and playing with
the bit, under which hung a silver eagle on a hinge.&nbsp; Waving
his hand towards his friends, Jango rode slowly through the
town.&nbsp; He passed through sandy streets of flat-roofed,
whitewashed houses, before whose doors stood hobbled horses
nodding in the sun.</p>
<p>He rode past orange gardens, surrounded by brown walls of
sun-baked bricks with the straw sticking in them, just as it had
dried.&nbsp; In the waste the castor-oil bushes formed little <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>jungles, out
of which peered cats, exactly as a tiger peers out of a real
jungle in the woods.</p>
<p>The sun poured down, and was reverberated back from the white
houses, and on the great gaunt building, where the
captain-general lived, floated the green-and-yellow flag of the
republic, looking like a bandana handkerchief.&nbsp; He passed
the negro rancheria, without which no such town as Santa Anna do
Libramento is complete, and might have marked, had he not been
too much used to see them, the naked negro children playing in
the sand.&nbsp; Possibly, if he marked them, he referred to them
as &ldquo;cachorrinhos pretos,&rdquo; for the old leaven of the
days of slavery is strongly rooted in Brazil.&nbsp; So he rode
on, a slight and graceful figure, bending to each movement of his
horse, his mobile, olive-coloured features looking like a bronze
masque in the fierce downpour of the sun.</p>
<p>As he rode on, his whip, held by a thong and dangling from his
fingers, swung against his horse&rsquo;s flanks, keeping time
rhythmically to its pace.&nbsp; He crossed the rivulet that flows
between the towns and came out on the little open plain that
separates them.&nbsp; From <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>habit, or because he felt himself
amongst unfriendly or uncomprehended people, he touched his knife
and his revolvers, hidden beneath his summer poncho, with his
right hand, and with his bridle arm held high, ready for all
eventualities, passed into just such another sandy street as he
had left behind.</p>
<p>Save that all looked a little newer, and that the stores were
better supplied with goods, and that there were no negro huts,
the difference was slight between the towns.&nbsp; True that the
green-and-yellow flag had given place to the barred
blue-and-white of Uruguay.&nbsp; An armed policeman stood at the
corners of the main thoroughfares, and water-carts went up and
down at intervals.&nbsp; The garden in the plaza had a
well-tended flower-garden.</p>
<p>A band was playing in the middle of it, and Jango could not
fail to notice that Rivera was more prosperous than was his
native town.</p>
<p>Whether that influenced him, or whether it was the glass of
ca&ntilde;a which he had at the first pulperia, is a moot point,
or whether the old antipathy between the races brought by his
ancestors from the peninsula; anyhow, he left his horse untied,
and with the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>reins thrown down before it as he got off to have his
drink.&nbsp; When he came out, a policeman called to him to
hobble it or tie it up.</p>
<p>Without a word he gathered up his reins, sprang at a bound
upon his horse, and, drawing his mother-of-pearl-handled pistol,
fired at the policeman almost as he sprang.&nbsp; The shot threw
up a shower of sand just in the policeman&rsquo;s face, and
probably saved Jango&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Drawing his pistol, the
man fired back, but Jango, with a shout and pressure of his
heels, was off like lightning, firing as he rode, and zig-zagging
across the street.&nbsp; The policeman&rsquo;s shot went wide,
and Jango, turning in the saddle, fired again and missed.</p>
<p>By this time men with pistols in their hands stood at the
doors of all the houses; but the Brazilian passed so rapidly,
throwing himself alternately now on the near side, now on the off
side of his horse, hanging by one foot across the croup and
holding with the other to the mane, that he presented no mark for
them to hit.</p>
<p>As he passed by the &ldquo;jefatura&rdquo; where the alcalde
and his friends were sitting smoking <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>just before the door, he fired with
such good aim that a large piece of plaster just above their
heads fell, covering them with dust.</p>
<p>Drawing his second pistol and still firing as he went, he
dashed out of the town, in spite of shots from every side, his
horse bounding like lightning as his great silver spurs ploughed
deep into its sides.&nbsp; When he had crossed the little bit of
neutral ground, and just as a patrol of cavalry appeared, ready
to gallop after him, a band of men from his own town came out to
meet him.</p>
<p>He stopped, and shouting out defiance to the Uruguayans, drew
up his horse, and lit a cigarette.&nbsp; Then, safe beyond the
frontier, trotted on gently to meet his friends, his horse
shaking white foam from off its bit, and little rivulets of blood
dripping down from its sides into the sand.</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>VIII<br />
EL TANGO ARGENTINO</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Motor-cars</span> swept up to the covered
passage of the front door of the hotel, one of those
international caravansaries that pass their clients through a
sort of vulgarising process that blots out every type.&nbsp; It
makes the Argentine, the French, the Englishman, and the American
all alike before the power of wealth.</p>
<p>The cars surged up as silently as snow falls from a fir-tree
in a thaw, and with the same soft swishing noise.&nbsp; Tall,
liveried porters opened the doors (although, of course, each car
was duly furnished with a footman) so nobly that any one of them
would have graced any situation in the State.</p>
<p>The ladies stepped down delicately, showing a fleeting vision
of a leg in a transparent stocking, just for an instant, through
the <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>slashing of their skirts.&nbsp; They knew that every
man, their footman, driver, the giant watchers at the gate, and
all who at the time were going into the hotel, saw and were moved
by what they saw just for a moment; but the fact did not trouble
them at all.&nbsp; It rather pleased them, for the most virtuous
feel a pleasurable emotion when they know that they excite.&nbsp;
So it will be for ever, for thus and not by votes alone they show
that they are to the full men&rsquo;s equals, let the law do its
worst.</p>
<p>Inside the hotel, heated by steam, and with an atmosphere of
scent and flesh that went straight to the head just as the fumes
of whisky set a drinker&rsquo;s nerves agog, were seated all the
finest flowers of the cosmopolitan society of the French
capital.</p>
<p>Lesbos had sent its legions, and women looked at one another
appreciatively, scanning each item of their neighbours&rsquo;
clothes, and with their colour heightening when by chance their
eyes met those of another priestess of their sect.</p>
<p>Rich rastaquaoures, their hats too shiny, and their boots too
tight, their coats fitting too closely, their sticks mounted with
great <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>gold
knobs, walked about or sat at little tables, all talking strange
varieties of French.</p>
<p>Americans, the men apparently all run out of the same mould,
the women apt as monkeys to imitate all that they saw in dress,
in fashion and in style, and more adaptable than any other women
in the world from lack of all traditions, conversed in their high
nasal tones.&nbsp; Spanish-Americans from every one of the
Republics were well represented, all talking about money: of how
Do&ntilde;a Fulana Perez had given fifteen hundred francs for her
new hat, or Don Fulano had just scored a million on the
Bourse.</p>
<p>Jews and more Jews, and Jewesses and still more Jewesses, were
there, some of them married to Christians and turned Catholic,
but betrayed by their Semitic type, although they talked of
Lourdes and of the Holy Father with the best.</p>
<p>After the &ldquo;five-o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; turned to a heavy
meal of toast and buns, of Hugel loaf, of sandwiches, and of hot
cake, the scented throng, restored by the refection after the
day&rsquo;s hard work of shopping, of driving here and there like
souls in purgatory to call on people that they detested, and
other labours of a like <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>nature, slowly adjourned to a great
hall in which a band was playing.&nbsp; As they walked through
the passages, men pressed close up to women and murmured in their
ears, telling them anecdotes that made them flush and giggle as
they protested in an unprotesting style.&nbsp; Those were the
days of the first advent of the Tango Argentino, the dance that
since has circled the whole world, as it were, in a movement of
the hips.&nbsp; Ladies pronounced it charming as they half closed
their eyes and let a little shiver run across their lips.&nbsp;
Men said it was the only dance that was worth dancing.&nbsp; It
was so Spanish, so unconventional, and combined all the
&aelig;sthetic movements of the figures on an Etruscan vase with
the strange grace of the Hungarian gipsies . . . it was so, as
one may say, so . . . as you may say . . . you know.</p>
<p>When all were seated, the band, Hungarians, of
course,&mdash;oh, those dear gipsies!&mdash;struck out into a
rhythm, half rag-time, half haba&ntilde;era, canaille, but
sensuous, and hands involuntarily, even the most aristocratic
hands&mdash;of ladies whose immediate progenitors had been
pork-packers in Chicago, or gambusinos <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>who had struck it rich in
Zacatecas,&mdash;tapped delicately, but usually a little out of
time, upon the backs of chairs.</p>
<p>A tall young man, looking as if he had got a holiday from a
tailor&rsquo;s fashion plate, his hair sleek, black, and stuck
down to his head with a cosmetic, his trousers so immaculately
creased they seemed cut out of cardboard, led out a girl dressed
in a skirt so tight that she could not have moved in it had it
not been cut open to the knee.</p>
<p>Standing so close that one well-creased trouser leg
disappeared in the tight skirt, he clasped her round the waist,
holding her hand almost before her face.&nbsp; They twirled
about, now bending low, now throwing out a leg, and then again
revolving, all with a movement of the hips that seemed to blend
the well-creased trouser and the half-open skirt into one
inharmonious whole.&nbsp; The music grew more furious and the
steps multiplied, till with a bound the girl threw herself for an
instant into the male dancer&rsquo;s arms, who put her back again
upon the ground with as much care as if she had been a new-laid
egg, and the pair bowed and disappeared.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Discreet applause broke forth, and exclamations such as
&ldquo;wonderful,&rdquo; &ldquo;what grace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vivent
les Espagnoles,&rdquo; for the discriminating audience took no
heed of independence days, of mere political changes and the
like, and seemed to think that Buenos Aires was a part of Spain,
never having heard of San Martin, Bolivar, Paez, and their
fellow-liberators.</p>
<p>Paris, London, and New York were to that fashionable crowd the
world, and anything outside&mdash;except, of course, the
Hungarian gipsies and the Tango dancers&mdash;barbarous and
beyond the pale.</p>
<p>After the Tango came &ldquo;La Maxixe
Br&eacute;silienne,&rdquo; rather more languorous and more
befitting to the dwellers in the tropics than was its cousin from
the plains.&nbsp; Again the discreet applause broke out, the
audience murmuring &ldquo;charming,&rdquo; that universal
adjective that gives an air of being in a perpetual
pastrycook&rsquo;s when ladies signify delight.&nbsp; Smiles and
sly glances at their friends showed that the dancers&rsquo;
efforts at indecency had been appreciated.</p>
<p>Slowly the hall and tea-rooms of the great <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>hotel emptied
themselves, and in the corridors and passages the smell of scent
still lingered, just as stale incense lingers in a church.</p>
<p>Motor-cars took away the ladies and their friends, and
drivers, who had shivered in the cold whilst the crowd inside
sweated in the central heating, exchanged the time of day with
the liveried doorkeepers, one of them asking anxiously,
&ldquo;Dis, Anatole, as-tu vu mes vaches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the soft closing of a well-hung door the last car took
its perfumed freight away, leaving upon the steps a group of men,
who remained talking over, or, as they would say, undressing, all
the ladies who had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Argentine Tango, eh?&rdquo; I thought, after my friends
had left me all alone.&nbsp; Well, well, it has changed
devilishly upon its passage overseas, even discounting the
difference of the setting of the place where first I saw it
danced so many years ago.&nbsp; So, sauntering down, I took a
chair far back upon the terrace of the Caf&eacute; de la Paix, so
that the sellers of <i>La Patrie</i>, and the men who have some
strange new toy, or views of Paris in a long album <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>like a broken
concertina, should not tread upon my toes.</p>
<p>Over a Porto Blanc and a Brazilian cigarette, lulled by the
noise of Paris and the raucous cries of the street-vendors, I
fell into a doze.</p>
<p>Gradually the smell of petrol and of horse-dung, the two most
potent perfumes in our modern life, seemed to be blown
away.&nbsp; Dyed heads and faces scraped till they looked blue as
a baboon&rsquo;s; young men who looked like girls, with painted
faces and with mincing airs; the raddled women, ragged men, and
hags huddled in knitted shawls, lame horses, and taxi-cab drivers
sitting nodding on their boxes&mdash;all faded into space, and
from the nothing that is the past arose another scene.</p>
<p>I saw myself with Witham and his brother, whose name I have
forgotten, Eduardo Pe&ntilde;a, Congreve, and Eustaquio Medina,
on a small rancho in an elbow of the great River Yi.&nbsp; The
rancho stood upon a little hill.&nbsp; A quarter of a mile or so
away the dense and thorny mont&eacute; of hard-wood trees that
fringed the river seemed to roll up towards it like a sea.&nbsp;
The house was built of yellow pine sent from the United
States.&nbsp; The roof was shingled, <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and the rancho stood planked down
upon the plain, looking exactly like a box.&nbsp; Some fifty
yards away stood a thatched hut that served as kitchen, and on
its floor the cattle herders used to sleep upon their horse-gear
with their feet towards the fire.</p>
<p>The corrals for horses and for sheep were just a little
farther off, and underneath a shed a horse stood saddled day in,
day out, and perhaps does so yet, if the old rancho still resists
the winds.</p>
<p>Four or five horses, saddled and bridled, stood tied to a
great post, for we were just about to mount to ride a league or
two to a Baile, at the house of Frutos Barrag&aacute;n.&nbsp;
Just after sunset we set out, as the sweet scent that the grasses
of the plains send forth after a long day of heat perfumed the
evening air.</p>
<p>The night was clear and starry, and above our heads was hung
the Southern Cross.&nbsp; So bright the stars shone out that one
could see almost a mile away; but yet all the perspective of the
plains and woods was altered.&nbsp; Hillocks were sometimes
undistinguishable, at other times loomed up like houses.&nbsp;
Woods seemed to sway and heave, and by the sides of streams <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>bunches of
Pampa grass stood stark as sentinels, their feathery tufts
looking like plumes upon an Indian&rsquo;s lance.</p>
<p>The horses shook their bridles with a clear, ringing sound as
they stepped double, and their riders, swaying lightly in their
seats, seemed to form part and parcel of the animals they
rode.</p>
<p>Now and then little owls flew noiselessly beside us, circling
above our heads, and then dropped noiselessly upon a bush.&nbsp;
Eustaquio Medina, who knew the district as a sailor knows the
seas where he was born, rode in the front of us.&nbsp; As his
horse shied at a shadow on the grass or at the bones of some dead
animal, he swung his whip round ceaselessly, until the moonlight
playing on the silver-mounted stock seemed to transform it to an
aureole that flickered about his head.&nbsp; Now and then
somebody dismounted to tighten up his girth, his horse twisting
and turning round uneasily the while, and, when he raised his
foot towards the stirrup, starting off with a bound.</p>
<p>Time seemed to disappear and space be swallowed in the
intoxicating gallop, so that <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>when Eustaquio Medina paused for an
instant to strike the crossing of a stream, we felt annoyed with
him, although no hound that follows a hot scent could have gone
truer on his line.</p>
<p>Dogs barking close at hand warned us our ride was almost over,
and as we galloped up a rise Eustaquio Medina pulled up and
turned to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just at the
bottom of the hollow, only five squares away,&rdquo; and as we
saw the flicker of the lights, he struck his palm upon his mouth
after the Indian fashion, and raised a piercing cry.&nbsp; Easing
his hand, he drove his spurs into his horse, who started with a
bound into full speed, and as he galloped down the hill we
followed him, all yelling furiously.</p>
<p>Just at the hitching-post we drew up with a jerk, our horses
snorting as they edged off sideways from the black shadow that it
cast upon the ground.&nbsp; Horses stood about everywhere, some
tied and others hobbled, and from the house there came the
strains of an accordion and the tinkling of guitars.</p>
<p>Asking permission to dismount, we hailed <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the owner of
the house, a tall, old Gaucho, Frutos Barrag&aacute;n, as he
stood waiting by the door, holding a mat&eacute; in his
hand.&nbsp; He bade us welcome, telling us to tie our horses up,
not too far out of sight, for, as he said, &ldquo;It is not good
to give facilities to rogues, if they should chance to be
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the low, straw-thatched rancho, with its eaves blackened by
the smoke, three or four iron bowls, filled with mare&rsquo;s
fat, and with a cotton wick that needed constant trimming, stuck
upon iron cattle-brands, were burning fitfully.</p>
<p>They cast deep shadows in the corners of the room, and when
they flickered up occasionally the light fell on the dark and
sun-tanned faces of the tall, wiry Gauchos and the light cotton
dresses of the women as they sat with their chairs tilted up
against the wall.&nbsp; Some thick-set Basques, an Englishman or
two in riding breeches, and one or two Italians made up the
company.&nbsp; The floor was earth, stamped hard till it shone
like cement, and as the Gauchos walked upon it, their heavy spurs
clinked with a noise like fetters as they trailed them on the
ground.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>An old,
blind Paraguayan played on the guitar, and a huge negro
accompanied him on an accordion.&nbsp; Their united efforts
produced a music which certainly was vigorous enough, and now and
then, one or the other of them broke into a song, high-pitched
and melancholy, which, if you listened to it long enough, forced
you to try to imitate its wailing melody and its strange
intervals.</p>
<p>Fumes of tobacco and rum hung in the air, and of a strong and
heady wine from Catalonia, much favoured by the ladies, which
they drank from a tumbler, passing it to one another, after the
fashion of a grace-cup at a City dinner, with great
gravity.&nbsp; At last the singing ceased, and the orchestra
struck up a Tango, slow, marked, and rhythmical.</p>
<p>Men rose, and, taking off their spurs, walked gravely to the
corner of the room where sat the women huddled together as if
they sought protection from each other, and with a compliment led
them out upon the floor.&nbsp; The flowing poncho and the loose
chirip&aacute;, which served as trousers, swung about just as the
tartans of a Highlander swing as he dances, giving an air of ease
to all the movements of <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the Gauchos as they revolved, their
partners&rsquo; heads peeping above their shoulders, and their
hips moving to and fro.</p>
<p>At times they parted, and set to one another gravely, and then
the man, advancing, clasped his partner round the waist and
seemed to push her backwards, with her eyes half-closed and an
expression of beatitude.&nbsp; Gravity was the keynote of the
scene, and though the movements of the dance were as significant
as it was possible for the dancers to achieve, the effect was
graceful, and the soft, gliding motion and the waving of the
parti-coloured clothes, wild and original, in the dim, flickering
light.</p>
<p>Rum flowed during the intervals.&nbsp; The dancers wiped the
perspiration from their brows, the men with the silk
handkerchiefs they wore about their necks, the women with their
sleeves.&nbsp; Tangos, cielitos, and pericones succeeded one
another, and still the atmosphere grew thicker, and the lights
seemed to flicker through a haze, as the dust rose from the mud
floor.&nbsp; Still the old Paraguayan and the negro kept on
playing with the sweat running down their faces, smoking and
drinking rum in their brief intervals of rest, and when the music
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>ceased for
a moment, the wild neighing of a horse tied in the moonlight to a
post, sounded as if he called his master to come out and gallop
home again.</p>
<p>The night wore on, and still the negro and the Paraguayan
stuck at their instruments.&nbsp; Skirts swung and ponchos waved,
whilst mat&eacute; circulated amongst the older men as they stood
grouped about the door.</p>
<p>Then came a lull, and as men whispered in their
partners&rsquo; ears, telling them, after the fashion of the
Gauchos, that they were lovely, their hair like jet, their eyes
bright as &ldquo;las tres Marias,&rdquo; and all the compliments
which in their case were stereotyped and handed down for
generations, loud voices rose, and in an instant two Gauchos
bounded out upon the floor.</p>
<p>Long silver-handled knives were in their hands, their ponchos
wrapped round their left arms served them as bucklers, and as
they crouched, like cats about to spring, they poured out
blasphemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop this!&rdquo; cried Frutos Barrag&aacute;n; but
even as he spoke, a knife-thrust planted in the stomach stretched
one upon the floor.&nbsp; Blood gushed out from his mouth, his
belly fell like <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>a pricked bladder, and a dark stream of blood trickled
upon the ground as he lay writhing in his death agony.</p>
<p>The iron bowls were overturned, and in the dark girls screamed
and the men crowded to the door.&nbsp; When they emerged into the
moonlight, leaving the dying man upon the floor, the murderer was
gone; and as they looked at one another there came a voice
shouting out, &ldquo;Adios, Barrag&aacute;n.&nbsp; Thus does
Vicente Castro pay his debts when a man tries to steal his
girl,&rdquo; and the faint footfalls of an unshod horse galloping
far out upon the plain.</p>
<p>I started, and the waiter standing by my side said,
&ldquo;Eighty centimes&rdquo;; and down the boulevard echoed the
harsh cry, &ldquo;<i>La Patrie</i>, achetez <i>La
Patrie</i>,&rdquo; and the rolling of the cabs.</p>

IN A BACKWATER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">This</span> &rsquo;ere war,
now,&rdquo; said the farmer, in the slow voice that tells of life
passed amongst comfortable surroundings into which haste has
never once intruded, &ldquo;is a &rsquo;orrid
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned upon a half-opened gate, keeping it swaying to and
fro a little with his foot.&nbsp; His waistcoat was unbuttoned,
showing his greasy braces and his checked blue shirt.&nbsp; His
box-cloth gaiters, falling low down upon his high-lows, left a
gap between them and his baggy riding-breeches, just below the
knee.&nbsp; His flat-topped bowler hat was pushed back over the
fringe of straggling grey hair upon his neck.&nbsp; His face was
burned a brick-dust colour with the August sun, and now and then
he mopped his forehead with a red handkerchief.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>His
little holding, an oasis in the waste of modern scientific
farming, was run in the old-fashioned way, often to be seen in
the home counties, as if old methods linger longest where they
are least expected, just as a hunted fox sometimes takes refuge
in a rectory.</p>
<p>His ideas seemed to have become unsettled with constant
reading of newspapers filled with accounts of horrors, and his
speech, not fluent at the best of times, was slower and more
halting than his wont.</p>
<p>He told how he had just lost his wife, and felt more than a
little put about to get his dairy work done properly without her
help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s lost his wife it leaves him,
somehow, as if he were like a &rsquo;orse hitched on one side of
the wagon-pole, a-pullin&rsquo; by hisself.&nbsp; Now this
&rsquo;ere war, comin&rsquo; as it does right on the top of my
&rsquo;ome loss, sets me a-thinkin&rsquo;, especially when
I&rsquo;m alone in the &rsquo;ouse of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The park-like English landscape, with its hedgerow trees and
its lush fields, that does not look like as if it really were the
country, but seems a series of pleasure-grounds cut off into
convenient squares, was at its time of greatest <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>beauty and
its greatest artificiality.&nbsp; Cows swollen with grass till
they looked like balloons lay in the fields and chewed the
cud.&nbsp; Geese cackled as they strayed upon the common, just as
they appear to cackle in a thousand water-colours.&nbsp; The hum
of bees was in the limes.&nbsp; Dragon-flies hawked swiftly over
the oily waters of the two slow-flowing rivers that made the farm
almost an island in a suburban Mesopotamia, scarce twenty miles
away from Charing Cross.&nbsp; An air of peace and of
contentment, of long well-being and security, was evident in
everything.&nbsp; Trees flourished, though stag-headed, under
which the Roundhead troopers may have camped, or at the least,
veterans from Marlborough&rsquo;s wars might have sat underneath
their shade, and smoked as they retold their fights.</p>
<p>A one-armed signboard, weathered, and with the lettering
almost illegible, pointed out the bridle-path to Ditchley, now
little used, except by lovers on a Sunday afternoon, but where
the feet of horses for generations in the past had trampled it,
still showing clearly as it wound through the fields.</p>
<p>In the standing corn the horses yoked to <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the reaping
machine stood resting, now and again shaking the tassels on their
little netted ear-covers.&nbsp; They, too, came of a breed long
used to peace and plenty, good food and treatment, and short
hours of work.&nbsp; The kindly landscape and the settled life of
centuries had formed the kind of man of which the farmer was a
prototype,&mdash;slow-footed and slow-tongued, and with his mind
as bowed as were his shoulders with hard work, by the continual
pressure of the hierarchy of wealth and station, that had left
him as much adscript to them as any of his ancestors had been
bound to their glebes.&nbsp; He held the <i>Daily Mail</i>, his
gospel and his <i>vade mecum</i>, crumpled in his hand as if he
feared to open it again to read more details of the war.&nbsp; A
simple soul, most likely just as oppressive to his labourers as
his superiors had always showed themselves to him, he could not
bear to read of violence, as all the tyranny that he had bent
under had been imposed so subtly that he could never see more
than the shadow of the hand that had oppressed him.</p>
<p>It pained him, above all things, to read about the wounded and
dead horses lying in <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>the corn, especially as he had
&ldquo;&rsquo;eard the &rsquo;arvest over there in Belgium was
going to be good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whirr of the machines reaping
the wheatfield sounded like the hum of some gigantic insect, and
as the binder ranged the sheaves in rows it seemed as if the
golden age had come upon the earth again, bringing with it peace
and plenty, with perhaps slightly stouter nymphs than those who
once followed the sickle-men in Arcady.</p>
<p>A man sat fishing in a punt just where the river broadened
into a backwater edged with willow trees.&nbsp; At times he threw
out ground-bait, and at times raised a stone bottle to his lips,
keeping one eye the while watchfully turned upon his float.&nbsp;
School children strayed along the road, as rosy and as
flaxen-haired as those that Gregory the Great thought fitting to
be angels, though they had never been baptized.</p>
<p>Now and again the farmer stepped into his field to watch the
harvesting, and cast an eye of pride and of affection on his
horses, and then, coming back to the gate, he drew the paper from
his pocket and read its columns, much in the way an Arab reads a
letter, murmuring <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>the words aloud until their meaning penetrated to his
brain.</p>
<p>Chewing a straw, and slowly rubbing off the grains of an ear
of wheat into his hand, he gazed over his fields as if he feared
to see in them some of the horrors that he read.&nbsp; Again he
muttered, with a puzzled air, &ldquo;&rsquo;Orrible!
&rsquo;undreds of men and &rsquo;orses lying in the corn.&nbsp;
It seems a sad thing to believe, doesn&rsquo;t it now?&rdquo; he
said; and as he spoke soldiers on motorcycles hurtled down the
road, leaving a trail of dust that perhaps looked like smoke to
him after his reading in the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; he remarked, after a vigorous
application of his blue handkerchief to his streaming face,
&ldquo;that these &rsquo;ere motorcycles &rsquo;ave a gun
fastened to them, over there in Belgium, where they are
a-goin&rsquo; on at it in such a way.&nbsp; The paper says,
&lsquo;Ranks upon ranks of &rsquo;em is just mowed down like
wheat.&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; &rsquo;Orrid, I call it, if it&rsquo;s
true, for now and then I think those chaps only puts that kind of
thing into their papers to &rsquo;ave a sale for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked about him as if, like Pilate, he was
looking for an elusive truth not to be found on earth, and then
walked down the road till he <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>came to the backwater where the man
was fishing in his punt.&nbsp; They looked at one another over a
yard or two of muddy water, and asked for news about the war, in
the way that people do from others who they must know are quite
as ignorant as they are themselves.&nbsp; The fisherman
&ldquo;&rsquo;ad given up readin&rsquo; the war noos; it&rsquo;s
all a pack of lies,&rdquo; and pointing to the water, said in a
cautious voice, &ldquo;Some people says they &rsquo;ears.&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t so sure about it; but, anyhow, it&rsquo;s always best
to be on the safe side.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he addressed himself
once more to the business of the day, and in the contemplation of
his float no doubt became as much absorbed into the universal
principle of nature as is an Indian sitting continually with his
eyes turned on his diaphragm.</p>
<p>Men passing down the road, each with a paper in his hand,
looked up and threw the farmer scraps of news, uncensored and
spiced high with details which had never happened, so that in
after years their children will most likely treasure as facts,
which they have received from long-lost parents, the wildest
fairy tales.</p>
<p>The slanting sun and lengthening shadows <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>brought the
farmer no relief of mind; and still men, coming home from work on
shaky bicycles, plied him with horrors as they passed by the
gate, their knee-joints stiff with the labours of the day,
seeming in want of oil.&nbsp; A thin, white mist began to creep
along the backwater.&nbsp; Unmooring his punt, the fisherman came
unwillingly to shore, and as he threw the fragments of his lunch
into the water and gathered up his tackle, looked back upon the
scene of his unfruitful labours with an air as of a man who has
been overthrown by circumstances, but has preserved his honour
and his faith inviolate.</p>
<p>Slinging his basket on his back, he trudged off homewards, and
instantly the fish began to rise.&nbsp; A line of cows was driven
towards the farm, their udders all so full of milk that they
swayed to and fro, just as a man sways wrapped in a Spanish
cloak, and as majestically.&nbsp; The dragon-flies had gone, and
in their place ghost-moths flew here and there across the
meadows, and from the fields sounded the corncrake&rsquo;s harsh,
metallic note.</p>
<p>The whirring of the reaper ceased, and when the horses were
unyoked the driver led <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>them slowly from the field.&nbsp; As
they passed by the farmer he looked lovingly towards them, and
muttered to himself, &ldquo;Dead &rsquo;orses and dead soldiers
lying by &rsquo;undreds in the standing corn. . . .&nbsp; I
wonder &rsquo;ow the folks out there in Belgium will &rsquo;ave a
relish for their bread next year.&nbsp; This &rsquo;ere
war&rsquo;s a &rsquo;orrid business, coming as it does, too, on
the top of my own loss . . . dead &rsquo;orses in the corn. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the straw out of his mouth, and walking up to one of
his own sleek-sided carthorses, patted it lovingly, as if he
wanted to make sure that it was still alive.</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>X<br
/>
HIPPOMORPHOUS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 12th of October 1524, Cortes
left Mexico on his celebrated expedition to Honduras.&nbsp; The
start from Mexico was made to the sound of music, and all the
population of the newly conquered city turned out to escort him
for a few miles upon his way.</p>
<p>The cavalcade must have been a curious spectacle enough.&nbsp;
Cortes himself and his chief officers rode partly dressed in
armour, after the fashion of the time.&nbsp; Then came the
Spanish soldiers, mostly on foot and armed with lances, swords,
and bucklers, though there was a troop of crossbowmen and
harquebusiers to whom &ldquo;after God&rdquo; we owed the
Conquest, as an old chronicler has said when speaking of the
Conquest of Peru.&nbsp; In Mexico they did good service also,
although it was the horsemen <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>that in that conquest played the
greater part.&nbsp; Then came a force of three thousand friendly
Indians from Tlascala, and last of all a herd of swine was driven
slowly in the rear, for at that time neither sheep nor cattle
were known in the New World.</p>
<p>Guatimozin, the captive King of Mexico, graced his
conquerors&rsquo; triumphal march; and with the army went two
falconers, Garci Caro and Alvaro Monta&ntilde;es, together with a
band of music, some acrobats, a juggler, and a man &ldquo;who
vaulted well and played the Moorish pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cortes rode the black horse which he had ridden at the siege
of Mexico.&nbsp; Fortune appeared to smile upon him.&nbsp; He had
just added an enormous empire to the Spanish crown, and proved
himself one of the most consummate generals of his age.&nbsp; Yet
he was on the verge of the great misfortune of his life, which at
the same time was to prove him still a finer leader than he had
been, even in Mexico.</p>
<p>His black horse also was about to play the most extraordinary
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> that ever horse has played in the whole history
of the world.</p>
<p>With varying fortunes, now climbing <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>mountains,
now floundering in swamps, and again passing rivers over which
they had to throw bridges, the expedition came to an open
country, well watered, and the home of countless herds of
deer.&nbsp; Villagutierre, in his <i>History of the Conquest of
the Province of Itza</i> (Madrid, 1701), calls it the country of
the Ma&ccedil;otecas, which name Bernal Diaz del Castillo says
means &ldquo;deer&rdquo; in the language of those infidels.&nbsp;
Fresh meat was scarce, and all the Spanish horsemen of those days
were experts with the lance.&nbsp; Instantly Cortes and all his
mounted officers set out to chase the deer.&nbsp; The weather was
extraordinarily hot, hotter, so Diaz says, than they had had it
since they left Mexico.&nbsp; The deer were all so tame that the
horsemen speared them as they chose (<i>los alancearon muy
&aacute; su placer</i>), and soon the plain was strewed with
dying animals just as it used to be when the Indians hunted
buffalo thirty or forty years ago.</p>
<p>Diaz says that the reason for the tameness of the deer was
that the Ma&ccedil;otecas (here he applies the word to the
Indians themselves) worshipped them as gods.&nbsp; It appears
that their Chief God had once appeared in the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>image of a
stag, and told the Indians not to hunt his fellow-gods, or even
frighten them.&nbsp; Little enough the Spaniards cared for any
gods not strong enough to defend themselves, for the deity that
they adored was the same God of Battles whom we adore to-day.</p>
<p>So they continued spearing the god-like beasts, regardless of
the heat and that their horses were in poor condition owing to
their long march.&nbsp; The horse of one Palacios Rubio, a
relation of Cortes, fell dead, overcome with the great heat; the
grease inside him melted, Villagutierre says.&nbsp; The black
horse that was ridden by Cortes also was very ill, although he
did not die&mdash;though it perhaps had been better that he
should have died, for Villagutierre thinks &ldquo;far less harm
would have been done than happened afterwards, as will be seen by
those who read the tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; After the hunting all was
over, the line of march led over stony hills, and through a pass
that Villagutierre calls &ldquo;el Paso del Alabastro,&rdquo; and
Diaz &ldquo;La Sierra de los Pedernales&rdquo; (flints).&nbsp;
Here the horse that had been ill, staked itself in a forefoot,
and this, as Villagutierre says, was the real reason that Cortes
left him behind.&nbsp; He <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>adds, &ldquo;It does not matter
either way, whether he was left because his grease was melted
with the sun, or that his foot was staked.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, of
course, is true, and anyhow the horse was reserved for a greater
destiny than ever fell to any of his race.</p>
<p>Cortes, in his fifth letter to the Emperor Charles V., says
simply, &ldquo;I was obliged to leave my black horse (<i>mi
caballo morzillo</i>) with a splinter in his foot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He takes no notice of the melting of the grease.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Chief promised to take care of him, but I do not know that he
will succeed or what he will do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told the Chief that he would send to fetch the horse, for
he was very fond of him, and prized him very much.&nbsp; The
Chief, no doubt, received the strange and terrible animal with
due respect, and Cortes went on upon his way.&nbsp; That is all
that Cortes says about the matter, and the mist of history closed
upon him and on his horse.&nbsp; Cortes died, worn-out and
broken-hearted, at the white little town of Castilleja de la
Cuesta, not far from Seville; but El Morzillo had a greater
destiny in store.&nbsp; This happened in the year 1525, and
nothing <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>more was heard of either the Ma&ccedil;otecas or the
horse, after that passage in the fifth letter of Cortes, till
1697.&nbsp; In that year the Franciscans set out upon the gospel
trail to convert the Indians of Itza, attached to the expedition
that Ursua led, for the interior of Yucatan had never been
subdued.&nbsp; They reached Itza, having come down the River Tipu
in canoes.</p>
<p>This river, Villagutierre informs us, is as large as any river
in all Spain.&nbsp; Moreover, it is endowed with certain
properties, its water being good and clear, so that in some
respects it is superior to the water even of the Tagus.&nbsp; It
is separated into one hundred and ninety channels (neither more
nor less), and every one of these has its right Indian name, that
every Indian knows.&nbsp; Upon its banks grows much sarsaparilla,
and in its sand is gold.</p>
<p>Beyond all this it has a hidden virtue, which is that taken
(fasting) it cures the dropsy, and makes both sick and sound
people eat heartily.&nbsp; Besides this, after eating, when you
have drunk its water you are inclined to eat again.</p>
<p>At midday it is cold, and warm at night, so warm that a steam
rises from it, just as it does when a kettle boils on the
fire.&nbsp; Other <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>particularities it has, which though they are not so
remarkable, yet are noteworthy.</p>
<p>Down this amazing river Ursua&rsquo;s expedition navigated for
twelve days in their canoes till they came to a lake called
Peten-Itza, in which there was an island known as Tayasal.&nbsp;
All unknown to themselves, they had arrived close to the place
where long ago Cortes had left his horse.&nbsp; Of this they were
in ignorance; the circumstance had been long forgotten, and
Cortes himself had become almost a hero of a bygone age even in
Mexico.</p>
<p>Fathers Orbieta and Fuensalida, monks of the Franciscan order,
chosen both for their zeal and for their knowledge of the Maya
language, were all agog to mark new sheep.&nbsp; The Indians
amongst whom they found themselves were &ldquo;ignorant even of
the knowledge of the true faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, since the
conquest they had had no dealings with Europeans, and were as
primitive as they were at the time when Cortes had passed, more
than a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>One of the Chiefs, a man known as Isquin, when he first saw a
horse, &ldquo;almost ran mad with joy and with
astonishment.&nbsp; Especially <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the evolutions and the leaps it made
into the air moved him to admiration, and going down upon all
fours he leaped about and neighed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, tired with
this practical manifestation of his joy and his astonishment, he
asked the Spanish name of the mysterious animal.&nbsp; When he
learned that it was caballo, he forthwith renounced his name, and
from that day this silly infidel was known as Caballito.&nbsp;
Then when the soul-cleansing water had been poured upon his head,
he took the name of Pedro, and to his dying day all the world
called him &ldquo;Don Pedro Caballito, for he was born a
Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This curious and pathetic little circumstance, by means of
which a brand was snatched red-hot from the eternal flames,
lighted for those who have deserved hell-fire by never having
heard of it, might, one would think, have shown the missionaries
that the poor Indians were but children, easier to lead than
drive.</p>
<p>It only fired their zeal, and yet all their solicitude to save
the Indians&rsquo; souls was unavailing, and the hard-hearted
savages, dead to the advantages that baptism has ever brought
with it, clave to their images.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>The
good Franciscans made several more attempts to move the
people&rsquo;s hearts by preaching ceaselessly.&nbsp; All failed,
and then they went to several islands in the lake, in one of
which Father Orbieta hardly had begun to preach, when, as Lopez
Cogulludo <a name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a> tells us, an Indian seized him by the
throat and nearly strangled him, leaving him senseless on the
ground.</p>
<p>At times, seated in church listening to what the Elizabethans
called &ldquo;a painful preacher,&rdquo; even the elect have felt
an impulse to seize him by the throat.&nbsp; Still, it is usually
restrained; but these poor savages, undisciplined in body and in
mind, were perhaps to be excused, for the full flavour of a
sermon had never reached them in their Eden by the lake.&nbsp;
Moreover, after he was thus rudely cast from the pulpit to the
ground, Father Fuensalida, nothing daunted by his fate, stepped
forward and took up his parable.&nbsp; He preached to them this
time in their own language, in which he was expert, with fervid
eloquence and great knowledge of the Scriptures, <a
name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a> explaining to <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>them the
holy mystery of the incarnation of the eternal Word. <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a>&nbsp; The subject was well chosen for
a first attempt upon their hearts; but it, too, proved
unfruitful, and the two friars were forced to re-embark.</p>
<p>As the canoe in which they sat moved from the island and
launched out into the lake, the infidels who stood and watched
them paddling were moved to fury, and, rushing to the edge,
stoned them whole-heartedly till they were out of reach.</p>
<p>It is a wise precaution, and one that the
&ldquo;conquistadores&rdquo; usually observed, to have the
spiritual well supported by the secular arm when missionaries,
instinct with zeal and not weighed down with too much common
sense, preach for the first time to the infidel.</p>
<p>This first reverse was but an incident, and by degrees the
friars, this time accompanied by soldiers, explored more of the
islands in the lake.&nbsp; At last they came to one called
Tayasal, which was so full of idols that they took twelve hours
to burn and to destroy them all.</p>
<p>One island still remained to be explored, <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and in it
was a temple with an idol much reverenced by the Indians.&nbsp;
At last they entered it, and on a platform about the height of a
tall man they saw the figure of a horse rudely carved out of
stone.</p>
<p>The horse was seated on the ground resting upon his quarters,
his hind legs bent and his front feet stretched out.&nbsp; The
barbarous infidels <a name="citation116a"></a><a
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a> adored the
abominable and monstrous beast under the name of Tziunchan, God
of the Thunder and the Lightning, and paid it reverence.&nbsp;
Even the Spaniards, who, as a rule, were not much given to
inquiring into the history of idols, but broke them instantly,
<i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>, were interested and amazed.&nbsp;
Little by little they learned the history of the hippomorphous
god, which had been carefully preserved.&nbsp; It appeared that
when Cortes had left his horse, so many years ago, the Indians,
seeing he was ill, took him into a temple to take care of
him.&nbsp; Thinking he was a reasoning animal, <a
name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b"
class="citation">[116b]</a> they placed before him fruit and
chickens, with the result that the poor beast&mdash;who, of
course, was <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>reasonable enough in his own way&mdash;eventually
died.</p>
<p>The Indians, terrified and fearful that Cortes would take
revenge upon them for the death of the horse that he had left for
them to care for and to minister to all his wants, before they
buried him, carved a rude statue in his likeness and placed it in
a temple in the lake.</p>
<p>The devil, who, as Villagutierre observes, is never slack to
take advantage when he can, seeing the blindness and the
superstition (which was great) of those abominable idolaters,
induced them by degrees to make a God of the graven image they
had made.&nbsp; Their veneration grew with time, just as bad
weeds grow up in corn, as Holy Writ sets forth for our example,
and that abominable statue became the chiefest of their gods,
though they had many others equally horrible.</p>
<p>As the first horses that they saw were ridden by the Spaniards
in the chase of the tame deer, and many shots were fired, the
Indians not unnaturally connected the explosions and the flames
less with the rider than the horse.&nbsp; Thus in the course of
years the evolution of the great god Tziunchan took place, and,
as <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the
missionaries said, these heathen steeped in ignorance adored the
work of their own hands.</p>
<p>Father Orbieta, not stopping to reflect that all of us adore
what we have made, but &ldquo;filled with the spirit of the Lord
and carried off with furious zeal for the honour of our
God,&rdquo; <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a> seized a great stone and in an instant
cast the idol down, then with a hammer he broke it into bits.</p>
<p>When Father Orbieta had finished his work and thus destroyed
one of the most curious monuments of the New World, which ought
to have been preserved as carefully as if it had been carved by
Praxiteles, &ldquo;with the ineffable and holy joy that filled
him, his face shone with a light so spiritual that it was
something to praise God for and to view with
delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most foolish actions usually inspire their
perpetrators with delight, although their faces do not shine with
spiritual joy when they have done them; so when one reads the
folly of this muddle-headed friar, it sets one hoping that
several of the stones went home upon his back as he sat paddling
the canoe.</p>
<p>The Indians broke into lamentations, <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>exclaiming,
&ldquo;Death to him, he has killed our God&rdquo;; but were
prevented from avenging his demise by the Spanish soldiers who
prudently had accompanied the friar.</p>
<p>Thus was the mystery of the eternal Word made manifest amongst
the Ma&ccedil;otecas, and a deity destroyed who for a hundred
years and more had done no harm to any one on earth . . . a thing
unusual amongst Gods.</p>
<h2><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>XI<br />
MUDEJAR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Brown</span>, severe, and wall-girt, the
stubborn city still held out.</p>
<p>Its proud traditions made it impossible for Zaragoza to
capitulate without a siege.&nbsp; As in the days of Soult, when
the heroic maid, the <i>artillera</i>, as her countrymen call her
with pride, when Palafox held up the blood and orange banner in
which float the lions and the castles of Castille, the city
answered shot for shot.</p>
<p>Fire spurted from the Moorish walls, built by the Beni Hud,
who reigned in Zaragoza, when still Sohail poured its protecting
rays upon the land.&nbsp; The bluish wreaths of smoke curled on
the Ebro, running along the water and enveloping the Coso as if
in a mist.</p>
<p>A dropping rifle-fire crackled out from the ramparts, and
above the castle the red flag <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of the Intransigent-Republic
shivered and fluttered in the breeze.</p>
<p>The Torre-Nueva sprang from the middle of the town, just as a
palm tree rises from the desert sands.&nbsp; It was built at the
time when Moorish artisans, infidel dogs who yet preserved the
secrets of the East amongst the Christians (may dogs defile their
graves), had spent their science and their love upon it.</p>
<p>Octagonal, and looking as if blown into the air by the
magician&rsquo;s art, it leaned a little to one side, and, as the
admiring inhabitants averred, drawing their right hands open over
their left arms, laughed at its rival of Bologna and at every
other tower on earth.</p>
<p>No finer specimen of the art known as Mudejar existed in all
Spain.&nbsp; Galleries cut it here and there; and ajimeces, the
little horseshoe windows divided by a marble pillar, loved of the
Moors, which tradition says they took from the rude openings in
their tents of camel&rsquo;s hair, gave light to the
inside.&nbsp; Stages of inclined planes led to the top, so
gradual in their ascent that once a Queen of Spain had ridden up
them to admire the view over the Sierras upon her palfrey, or her
donkey, for all is one <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>when treating of a queen, who of a
certainty ennobles the animal she deigns to ride upon.&nbsp; Bold
ajaracas, the patterns proper to the style of architecture, stood
up in high relief upon its sides, and near the balustrade upon
the top a band of bluish tiles relieved the brownness of the
brickwork and sparkled in the sun.&nbsp; Sieges and time and
storms, rain, wind, and snow had spared it; even the neglect of
centuries had left it unimpaired&mdash;erect and elegant as a
young Arab maiden carrying water from the well.&nbsp; Architects
said that it inclined a little more each year, and talked about
subsidences; but they were foreigners, unused to the things of
Spain, and no one marked them; and the tower continued to be
loved and prized and to fall into disrepair.&nbsp; On this
occasion riflemen lined the galleries, pouring a hot fire upon
the attacking forces of the Government.</p>
<p>Encamped upon the heights above Torero, the Governmental army
held the banks of the canal that gives an air of Holland to that
part of the adust and calcined landscape of Aragon.</p>
<p>The General&rsquo;s quarters overlooked the town, and from
them he could see Santa <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Engracia, in whose crypt repose the
bodies of the martyrs in an atmosphere of ice, standing alone
upon its little plaza, fringed by a belt of stunted and ill-grown
acacia trees.&nbsp; The great cathedral, with its domes, in which
the shrine of the tutelary Virgin of the Pilar, the Pilarica of
the country folk, glittering with jewels and with silver plate,
is venerated as befits the abiding place on earth of the
miraculous figure sent direct from heaven, towered into the
sky.</p>
<p>Churches and towers and convents, old castellated houses with
their overhanging eaves and coats-of-arms upon the doors, jewels
of architecture, memorials of the past, formed as it were a
jungle wrought in a warm brown stone.&nbsp; Beyond the city
towered the mountains that hang over Huesca of the Bell.&nbsp;
Through them the Aragon has cut its roaring passages towards
Sobrarbe to the south.&nbsp; Northwards they circle Jaca, the
virgin little city that beat off the Moors a thousand years ago,
and still once every year commemorates her prowess outside the
walls, where Moors and Christians fight again the unequal
contest, into which St. James, mounted upon his milk-white <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>charger,
had plunged and thrown the weight of his right arm.&nbsp; The
light was so intense and African that on the mountain sides each
rock was visible, outlined as in a camera-lucida, and as the
artillery played upon the tower the effects of every salvo showed
up distinctly on the crumbling walls.&nbsp; All round the
Government&rsquo;s encampment stood groups of peasantry who had
been impressed together with their animals to bring
provisions.&nbsp; Wrapped in their brown and white checked
blankets, dressed in tight knee-breeches, short jackets, and grey
stockings, and shod with alpargatas&mdash;the canvas, hemp-soled
sandals that are fastened round the ankles with blue
cords&mdash;they stood and smoked, stolid as Moors, and as
unfathomable as the deep mysterious corries of their hills.</p>
<p>When the artillery thundered and the breaches in the walls
grew daily more apparent and more ominous, the country people
merely smiled, for they were sure the Pilarica would preserve the
city; and even if she did not, all Governments, republican or
clerical, were the same to them.</p>
<p>All their ambition was to live quietly, each <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>in his
village, which to him was the hub round which the world
revolved.</p>
<p>So one would say, as they stood watching the progress of the
siege: &ldquo;Chiquio, the sciences advance a bestiality, the
Government in the Madrids can hear each cannon-shot.&nbsp; The
sound goes on those wires that stretch upon the posts we tie our
donkeys to when we come into town. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little by little the forces of the Government advanced,
crossing the Ebro at the bridge which spans it in the middle of
the great double promenade called the Coso, and by degrees drew
near the walls.</p>
<p>The stubborn guerrilleros in the town contested every point of
vantage, fighting like wolves, throwing themselves with knives
and scythes stuck upright on long poles upon the troops.</p>
<p>So fought their grandfathers against the French, and so Strabo
describes their ancestors, adding, &ldquo;The Spaniard is a
taciturn, dark man, usually dressed in black; he fights with a
short sword, and always tries to come to close grips with our
legionaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As happens in all civil wars, when brother <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>finds
himself opposed to brother, the strife was mortal, and he who
fell received no mercy from the conqueror.</p>
<p>The riflemen upon the Torre Nueva poured in their fire,
especially upon the Regiment of Pavia, whose Colonel, Don Luis
Montoro, on several occasions gave orders to the artillerymen at
any cost to spare the tower.</p>
<p>Officer after officer fell by his side, and soldiers in the
ranks cursed audibly, covering the saints with filth, as runs the
phrase in Spanish, and wondering why their Colonel did not
dislodge the riflemen who made such havoc in their files.&nbsp;
Discipline told at last, and all the Intransigents were forced
inside the walls, leaving the moat with but a single plank to
cross it by which to reach the town.&nbsp; Upon the plank the
fire was concentrated from the walls, and the besiegers stood for
a space appalled, sheltering themselves as best they could behind
the trees and inequalities of the ground.</p>
<p>Montoro called for volunteers, and one by one three grizzled
soldiers, who had grown grey in wars against the Moors, stepped
forward and fell pierced with a dozen wounds.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>After
a pause there was a movement in the ranks, and with a sword in
his right hand, and in his left the colours of Castille, his
brown stuff gown tucked up showing his hairy knees knotted and
muscular, out stepped a friar, and strode towards the
plank.&nbsp; Taking the sword between his teeth he crossed
himself, and beckoning on the men, rushed forward in the thickest
of the fire.</p>
<p>He crossed in safety, and then the regiment, with a hoarse
shout of &ldquo;Long live God,&rdquo; dashed on behind him, some
carrying planks and others crossing upon bales of straw, which
they had thrown into the moat.&nbsp; Under the walls they formed
and rushed into the town, only to find each house a fortress and
each street blocked by a barricade.&nbsp; From every window dark
faces peered, and a continual fusillade was poured upon them,
whilst from the house-tops the women showered down tiles.</p>
<p>Smoke filled the narrow streets, and from dark archways groups
of desperate men came rushing, armed with knives, only to fall in
heaps before the troops who, with fixed bayonets, steadily pushed
on.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>A
shift of wind cleared off the smoke and showed the crimson flag
still floating from the citadel, ragged and torn by shots.&nbsp;
Beyond the town appeared the mountains peeping out shyly through
the smoke, as if they looked down on the follies of mankind with
a contemptuous air.</p>
<p>Dead bodies strewed the streets, in attitudes half tragical,
half ludicrous, some looking like mere bundles of old clothes,
and some distorted with a stiff arm still pointing to the
sky.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of a little square the friar lay shot
through the forehead, his sword beside him, and with the flag
clasped tightly to his breast.</p>
<p>His great brown eyes stared upwards, and as the soldiers
passed him some of them crossed themselves, and an old sergeant
spoke his epitaph: &ldquo;This friar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
not of those fit only for the Lord; he would have made a soldier,
and a good one; may God have pardoned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driven into the middle plaza of the town, the Intransigents
fought till the last, selling their lives for more than they were
worth, and dying silently.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>The
citadel was taken with a rush, and the red flag hauled down.</p>
<p>Bugles rang out from the other angle of the plaza; the General
and his staff rode slowly forward to meet the Regiment of Pavia
as it debouched into the square.</p>
<p>Colonel Montoro halted, and then, saluting, advanced towards
his chief.&nbsp; His General, turning to him, angrily exclaimed,
&ldquo;Tell me, why did you let those fellows in the tower do so
much damage, when a few shots from the field guns would have soon
finished them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Montoro hesitated, and recovering his sword once more saluted
as his horse fretted on the curb, snorting and sidling from the
dead bodies that were strewed upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My General,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not for all Spain
and half the Indies would I have trained the cannon on the tower;
it is Mudejar of the purest architecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His General smiled at him a little grimly, and saying,
&ldquo;Well, after all, this is no time to ask accounts from any
man,&rdquo; touched his horse with the spur and, followed by his
staff, he disappeared into the town.</p>
<h2><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>XII<br />
A MINOR PROPHET</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> city sweltered in the August
heat.&nbsp; No breath of air lifted the pall of haze that wrapped
the streets, the houses, and the dark group of Gr&aelig;co-Roman
buildings that stands up like a rock in the dull tide-way of the
brick-built tenements that compose the town.</p>
<p>Bells pealed at intervals, summoning the fractioned faithful
to their various centres of belief.</p>
<p>When they had ceased and all the congregations were assembled
listening to the exhortations of their spiritual advisers, and
were employed fumbling inside their purses, as they listened, for
the destined &ldquo;threepenny,&rdquo; that obolus which gives
respectability to alms, the silence was complete.&nbsp;
Whitey-brown paper bags, dropped overnight, just stirred <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>occasionally as the air swelled their bellies, making
them seem alive, or as alive as is a jelly-fish left stranded by
the tide.</p>
<p>Just as the faithful were assembled in their conventicles
adoring the same Deity, all filled with rancour against one
another because their methods of interpretation of the
Creator&rsquo;s will were different, so did the politicians and
the cranks of every sort and sect turn out to push their methods
of salvation for mankind.&nbsp; In groups they gathered round the
various speakers who discoursed from chairs and carts and points
of vantage on the streets.</p>
<p>Above the speakers&rsquo; heads, banners, held up between two
poles, called on the audiences to vote for Liberal or for Tory,
for Poor Law Reform, for Social Purity, and for Temperance.&nbsp;
Orators, varying from well-dressed and glibly-educated hacks from
party centres, to red-faced working-men, held forth perspiring,
and occasionally bedewing those who listened to them with saliva,
after an emphatic burst.</p>
<p>It seemed so easy after listening to them to redress all
wrongs, smooth out all wrinkles, and instate each citizen in his
own shop where he could sell his sweated goods, with the best <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>advantage
to himself and with the greatest modicum of disadvantage to his
neighbour, that one was left amazed at the dense apathy of those
who did not fall in with the nostrums they had heard.&nbsp;
Again, at other platforms, sleek men in broadcloth, who had never
seen a plough except at Agricultural Exhibitions, nor had got on
closer terms of friendship with a horse than to be bitten by him
as they passed along a street, discoursed upon the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, I say, the land is a fixed quantity, you
can&rsquo;t increase it, and without it, it&rsquo;s impossible to
live.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow is it, then, that all the land of England
is in so few hands?&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused and mopped his face,
and looking round, began again: &ldquo;Friends&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
allow me to style you Friends, I know, Friends in the sycred
cause of Liberty&mdash;the landed aristocracy is our enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not out for confiscation, why should I?&nbsp; I
&rsquo;ave my &rsquo;ome purchased with the fruits of my own
hhonest toil . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could conclude his sentence, a dock labourer,
dressed in his Sunday suit of shoddy serge, check shirt, and
black silk handkerchief knotted loosely round his neck, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>looked up,
and interjected: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ard work, too, mate, that
&rsquo;ere talkin&rsquo; in the sun is, that built your
&rsquo;ome.&nbsp; Beats coal whippin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just for an instant the orator was disconcerted as a laugh ran
through the audience; but habit, joined to a natural gift of
public speaking, came to his aid, and he rejoined: &ldquo;Brother
working-men, I say ditto to what has fallen from our friend
&rsquo;ere upon my right.&nbsp; We all are working-men.&nbsp;
Some of us, like our friend, work with their &rsquo;ands, and
others with their &rsquo;eds.&nbsp; In either case, the Land is
what we &rsquo;ave to get at as an article of prime
necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rapidly he sketched a state of things in which a happy
population, drawn from the slums, but all instinct with
agricultural knowledge, would be settled on the land, each on his
little farm, and all devoted to intensive culture in the most
modern form.&nbsp; Trees would be all cut down, because they only
&ldquo;&rsquo;arbour&rdquo; birds that eat the corn.&nbsp; Hedges
would all be extirpated, for it is known to every one that mice
and rats and animals of every kind live under them, and that they
only serve to shelter game.&nbsp; Each man would own <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>a gun and
be at liberty to kill a &ldquo;rabbut&rdquo; or a
&ldquo;&rsquo;are&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;animals, as we say at
college, <i>feery naturrey</i>, and placed by Providence upon the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These noble sentiments evoked applause, which was a little
mitigated by an interjection from a man in gaiters, with a
sunburnt face, of: &ldquo;Mister, if every one is to have a gun
and shoot, &rsquo;ow long will these &rsquo;ere &rsquo;ares and
rabbuts last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on, as thinly covered by his indecently
transparent veil of reciprocity as a bare-footed dancer in her
Grecian clothes, or a tall ostrich under an inch of sand, and yet
as confident as either of them that the essential is concealed, a
staunch Protectionist discoursed.&nbsp; With copious notes, to
which he turned at intervals, when he appealed to those
statistics which can be made in any question to fit every side,
he talked of loss of trade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friends, we must tax the
foreigner.&nbsp; It is this way, you see, our working classes
have to compete with other nations, all of which enjoy protective
duties.&nbsp; I ask you, is it reasonable that we should let a
foreign article come into England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a dour-looking Scotsman almost spat <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>out the
words: &ldquo;Man, can ye no juist say Great Britain?&rdquo; and
received a bow and &ldquo;Certainly, my friend, I am not here to
wound the sentiments of any man . . . as I was saying, is it
reasonable that goods should come to England . . . I mean Great
Britain, duty free, and yet articles we manufacture have to pay
heavy duties in any foreign port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow about bread?&rdquo; came from a voice upon
the outskirts of the crowd.</p>
<p>The speaker reddened, and resumed: &ldquo;My friend, man doth
not live by bread alone; still, I understand the point.&nbsp; A
little dooty upon corn, say five shillings in the quarter, would
not hurt any one.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to do it.&nbsp; The
foreigner is the enemy.&nbsp; I am a Christian; but yet,
readin&rsquo; as I often do the Sermon on the Mount, I never saw
we had to lie down in the dust and let ourselves be trampled
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are to be the inheritors of the earth?&nbsp; Our
Lord says, &lsquo;Blessed are the meek; they shall inherit
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and was about to clinch his argument, when a tall
Irishman, after expectorating judiciously upon a vacant space
between two listeners, shot in: &ldquo;Shure, then, <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>the English
are the meekest of the lot, for they have got the greater part of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At other gatherings Socialists held forth under the red
flag.&nbsp; &ldquo;That banner, comrades, which &rsquo;as braved
a &rsquo;undred fights, and the mere sight of which makes the
Capitalistic bloodsucker tremble as he feels the time approach
when Lybor shall come into its inheritance and the Proletariat
shyke off its chaine and join &rsquo;ands all the world over,
despizin&rsquo; ryce and creed and all the artificial
obstructions that a designin&rsquo; Priest-&rsquo;ood and a
blood-stained Plutocracy &rsquo;ave placed between them to
distract their attention from the great cause of Socialism, the
great cause that mykes us comrades . . . &rsquo;ere, keep off my
&rsquo;oof, you blighter, with your ammunition wagons. . .
.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Religionists of various sects, all with long hair and dressed
in shabby black, the Book either before them on a campaigning
lectern or tucked beneath one arm, called upon Christian men to
dip their hands into the precious blood and drink from the
eternal fountain of pure water that is to be found in the
Apocalypse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to &rsquo;Im, come to &rsquo;Im, I
say, my friends, come straight; oh, it is <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>joyful to
belong to Jesus.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stop for anything, come to
&rsquo;Im now like little children. . . .&nbsp; Let us sing a
&rsquo;ymn.&nbsp; You know it, most of you; but brother
&rsquo;ere,&rdquo; and as he spoke he turned towards a pale-faced
youth who held a bag to take the offertory, that sacrament that
makes the whole world kin, &ldquo;will lead it for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acolyte cleared his throat raucously, and to a popular air
struck up the refrain of &ldquo;Let us jump joyful on the
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Flat-breasted girls and pale-faced boys took
up the strain, and as it floated through the heavy air,
reverberating from the pile of public buildings, gradually all
the crowd joined in; shyly at first and then whole-heartedly, and
by degrees the vulgar tune and doggerel verses took on an air of
power and dignity, and when the hymn was finished, the tears
stood in the eyes of grimy-looking women and of red-faced
men.&nbsp; Then, with his bag, the pale-faced hymn-leader went
through the crowd, reaping a plenteous harvest, all in copper,
from those whose hearts had felt, but for a moment, the full
force of sympathy.</p>
<p>Suffragist ladies discussed upon &ldquo;the <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Question,&rdquo; shocking their hearers as they touched
on prostitution and divorce, and making even stolid policemen,
who stood sweating in their thick blue uniforms, turn their eyes
upon the ground.</p>
<p>After them, Suffragette girls bounded upon the cart,
consigning fathers, brothers, and the whole male section of
mankind straight to perdition as they held forth upon the Vote,
that all-heal of the female politician, who thinks by means of it
to wipe out all those disabilities imposed upon her by an
unreasonable Nature and a male Deity, who must have worked alone
up in the Empyrean without the humanising influence of a
wife.</p>
<p>Little by little the various groups dissolved, the speakers
and their friends forcing their &ldquo;literatoor&rdquo; upon the
passers-by, who generally appeared to look into the air a foot or
two above their heads, as they went homewards through the
streets.</p>
<p>The Anarchists were the last to leave, a faithful few still
congregating around a youth in a red necktie who denounced the
other speakers with impartiality, averring that they were
&ldquo;humbugs every one of them,&rdquo; and, for <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>his part,
he believed only in dynamite, by means of which he hoped some day
to be able to devote &ldquo;all the blood-suckers to destruction,
and thus to bring about the reign of brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little knot of the elect applauded loudly, and the youth,
catching the policeman&rsquo;s eye fixed on him, descended
hurriedly from off the chair on which he had been perorating,
remarking that &ldquo;it was time to be going home to have a bit
of dinner, as he was due to speak at Salford in the
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the square was emptied, the last group or two of people
disappearing into the mouths of the incoming streets just as a
Roman crowd must have been swallowed up in the vomitoria of an
amphitheatre, after a show of gladiators.</p>
<p>Torn newspapers and ends of cigarettes were the sole result of
all the rhetoric that had been poured out so liberally upon the
assembled thousands in the square.</p>
<p>Two or three street boys in their shirt-sleeves, bare-footed
and bare-headed, their trousers held up by a piece of string,
played about listlessly, after the fashion of their kind <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>on Sunday
in a manufacturing town, when the life of the streets is dead,
and when men&rsquo;s minds are fixed either upon the mysteries of
the faith or upon beer, things in which children have but little
share.</p>
<p>The usual Sabbath gloom was creeping on the town and
dinner-time approaching, when from a corner of the square
appeared a man advancing rapidly.&nbsp; He glanced about
inquiringly, and for a moment a look of disappointment crossed
his face.&nbsp; Mounting the steps that lead up to the
smoke-coated Areopagus, he stopped just for an instant, as if to
draw his breath and gather his ideas.&nbsp; Decently dressed in
shabby black, his trousers frayed a little above the heels of his
elastic-sided boots, his soft felt hat that covered long but
scanty hair just touched with grey, he had an air as of a plaster
figure set in the middle of a pond, as he stood silhouetted
against the background of the buildings, forlorn yet
resolute.</p>
<p>The urchins, who had gathered round him, had a look upon their
faces as of experienced critics at a play; that look of
expectation and subconscious irony which characterises all their
kind at public spectacles.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Their
appearance, although calculated to appal a speaker broken to the
platform business, did not influence the man who stood upon the
steps.&nbsp; Taking off his battered hat, he placed it and his
umbrella carefully upon the ground.&nbsp; A light, as of the
interior fire that burned in the frail tenement of flesh so
fiercely that it illuminated his whole being, shone in his mild
blue eyes.&nbsp; Clearing his throat, and after running his
nervous hands through his thin hair, he pitched his voice well
forward, as if the deserted square had been packed full of people
prepared to hang upon his words.&nbsp; His voice, a little hoarse
and broken during his first sentences, gradually grew clearer,
developing a strength quite incommensurate with the source from
which it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, causing the boys to grin
and waking up the dozing policeman, &ldquo;I have a doctrine to
proclaim.&nbsp; Love only rules the world.&nbsp; The Greek word
<i>caritas</i> in the New Testament should have been rendered
love.&nbsp; Love suffereth long.&nbsp; Love is not puffed up;
love beareth all things.&nbsp; That is what the Apostle really
meant to say.&nbsp; Often within this very square I have stood
listening to the <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>speeches, and have weighed them in my mind.&nbsp; It is
not for me to criticise, only to advocate my own belief.&nbsp;
Friends . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his voice had gathered strength, two or three working-men,
attracted by the sight of a man speaking to the air, surrounded
but by the street boys and the nodding policeman on his beat, had
gathered round about.&nbsp; Dressed in their Sunday clothes; well
washed, and with the look as of restraint that freedom from their
accustomed toil often imparts to them on Sunday, they listened
stolidly, with that toleration that accepts all doctrines, from
that of highest Toryism down to Anarchy, and acts on none of
them.&nbsp; The speaker, spurred on by the unwonted sight of
listeners, for several draggled women had drawn near, and an
ice-cream seller had brought his donkey-cart up to the nearest
curb-stone, once more launched into his discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, when I hear the acerbity of the address of
some; when I hear doctrines setting forth the rights but leaving
out the duties of the working class; when I hear men defend the
sweater and run down the sweated, calling them thriftless, idle,
and intemperate, when <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>often they are but unfortunate, I
ask myself, what has become of Love?&nbsp; Who sees more clearly
than I do myself what the poor have to suffer?&nbsp; Do I not
live amongst them and share their difficulties?&nbsp; Who can
divine better than one who has imagination&mdash;and in that
respect I thank my stars I have not been left quite
unendowed&mdash;what are the difficulties of those high placed by
fortune, who yet have got to strive to keep their place?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweaters and sweated, the poor, the rich, men, women,
children, all mankind, suffer from want of Love.&nbsp; I am not
here to say that natural laws will ever cease to operate, or that
there will not be great inequalities, if not of fortune, yet of
endowments, to the end of Time.&nbsp; What the Great Power who
sent us here intended, only He can tell.&nbsp; One thing He
placed within the grasp of every one, capacity to love.&nbsp;
Think, friends, what England might become under the reign of
universal love.&nbsp; The murky fumes that now defile the
landscape, the manufactories in which our thousands toil for
others, the rivers vile with refuse, the knotted bodies and the
faces scarcely human in their abject struggle for their daily
bread, <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>would disappear.&nbsp; Bradford and Halifax and Leeds
would once again be fair and clean.&nbsp; The ferns would grow
once more in Shipley Glen, and in the valleys about Sheffield the
scissor-grinders would ply their trade upon streams bright and
sparkling, as they were of yore.&nbsp; In Halifax, the Roman
road, now black with coal-dust and with mud, would shine as
well-defined as it does where now and then it crops out from the
ling upon the moors, just as the Romans left it polished by their
caligul&aelig;.&nbsp; Why, do you ask me?&nbsp; Because all
sordid motives would be gone, and of their superfluity the rich
would give to those less blessed by Providence.&nbsp; The poor
would grudge no one the gifts of fortune, and thus the need for
grinding toil would disappear, as the struggle and the strain for
daily bread would fade into the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picture to yourselves, my friends, an England once more
green and merry, with the air fresh and not polluted by the smoke
of foetid towns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pleasant, friends, on a spring morning to
hear the village bells calling to church, even although they do
not call you to attend.&nbsp; It <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>heals the soul to see the
honeysuckle and the eglantine and smell the new-mown hay. . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then comes a chill when on your vision rises the
England of the manufacturing town, dark, dreary, and befouled
with smoke.&nbsp; How different it might be in the perpetual May
morning I have sketched for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love suffereth all things, endureth all things,
createth all things. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and, looking round, saw he was all alone.&nbsp; The
boys had stolen away, and the last workman&rsquo;s sturdy back
could be just seen as it was vanishing towards the
public-house.</p>
<p>The speaker sighed, and wiped the perspiration from his
forehead with a soiled handkerchief.</p>
<p>Then, picking up his hat and his umbrella, a far-off look came
into his blue eyes as he walked homewards almost jauntily,
conscious that the inner fire had got the better of the fleshly
tenement, and that his work was done.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>XIII<br />
EL MASGAD</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> camp was pitched upon the north
bank of the Wad Nefis, not far from Tamoshlacht.&nbsp; Above it
towered the Atlas, looking like a wall, with scarce a peak to
break its grim monotony.&nbsp; A fringe of garden lands enclosed
the sanctuary, in which the great Sherif lived in patriarchal
style; half saint, half warrior, but wholly a merchant at the
bottom, as are so many Arabs; all his surroundings enjoyed
peculiar sanctity.</p>
<p>In the long avenue of cypresses the birds lived safely, for no
one dared to frighten them, much less to fire a shot.&nbsp; His
baraka, that is the grace abounding, that distils from out the
clothes, the person and each action of men such as the Sherif,
who claim descent in apostolic continuity from the Blessed One,
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Mohammed, Allah&rsquo;s own messenger, protected
everything.&nbsp; Of a mean presence, like the man who stood upon
the Areopagus and beckoned with his hand, before he cast the
spell of his keen, humoristic speech upon the Greeks, the holy
one was of a middle stature.&nbsp; His face was marked with
smallpox.&nbsp; His clothes were dirty, and his haik he sometimes
mended with a thorn, doubling it, and thrusting one end through a
slit to form a safety-pin.&nbsp; His shoes were never new, his
turban like an old bath towel; yet in his belt he wore a dagger
with a gold hilt, for he was placed so far above the law, by
virtue of his blood, that though the Koran especially enjoins the
faithful not to wear gold, all that he did was good.</p>
<p>Though he drank nothing but pure water, or, for that matter,
lapped it like a camel, clearing the scum off with his fingers if
on a journey, he might have drank champagne or brandy, or mixed
the two of them, for the Arabs are the most logical of men, and
to them such a man as the Sherif is holy, not from anything he
does, but because Allah has ordained it.&nbsp; An attitude of
mind as good as <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>any other, and one that, after all, makes a man
tolerant of human frailties.</p>
<p>Allah gives courage, virtue, eloquence, or skill in
horsemanship.&nbsp; He gives or he withholds them for his good
pleasure; what he has written he has written, and therefore he
who is without these gifts is not held blamable.&nbsp; If he
should chance to be a saint, that is a true descendant, in the
male line, from him who answered nobly when his foolish followers
asked him if his young wife, Ayesha, should sit at his right hand
in paradise, &ldquo;By Allah, not she; but old Kadijah, she who
when all men mocked me, cherished and loved, she shall sit at my
right hand,&rdquo; that is enough for them.</p>
<p>So the Sherif was honoured, partly because he had great jars
stuffed with gold coin, the produce of his olive yards, and also
of the tribute that the faithful brought him; partly because of
his descent; and perhaps, more than all, on account of his great
store of Arab lore on every subject upon earth.&nbsp; His fame
was great, extending right through the Sus, the Draa, and down to
Taza&ucirc;elt, where it met the opposing current of the grace of
Bashir-el-Biruk, Sherif of the Wad-Nun.&nbsp; He liked to talk to
<a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Europeans, partly to show his learning, and partly to
hear about the devilries they had invented to complicate their
lives.</p>
<p>So when the evening prayer was called, and all was silent in
his house, the faithful duly prostrate on their faces before
Allah, who seems to take as little heed of them as he does of the
other warring sects, each with its doctrine of damnation for
their brethren outside the pale, the Sherif, who seldom prayed,
knowing that even if he did so he could neither make nor yet
unmake himself in Allah&rsquo;s sight, called for his mule, and
with two Arabs running by his side set out towards the
unbeliever&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>Though the Sherif paid no attention to it, the scene he rode
through was like fairyland.&nbsp; The moonbeams falling on the
domes of house and mosque and sanctuary lit up the green and
yellow tiles, making them sparkle like enamels.&nbsp; Long
shadows of the cypresses cast great bands of darkness upon the
red sand of the avenue.&nbsp; The croaking of the frogs sounded
metallic, and by degrees resolved itself into a continuous
tinkle, soothing and musical, in the Atlas night.&nbsp; Camels
lay ruminating, their <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>monstrous packs upon their
backs.&nbsp; As the Sherif passed by them on his mule they
snarled and bubbled, and a faint odour as of a menagerie, mingled
with that of tar, with which the Arabs cure their girth and
saddle galls, floated towards him, although no doubt custom had
made it so familiar that he never heeded it.</p>
<p>From the Arab huts that gather around every sanctuary, their
owners living on the baraka, a high-pitched voice to the
accompaniment of a two-stringed guitar played with a piece of
stiff palmetto leaf, and the monotonous Arab drum, that if you
listen to it long enough invades the soul, blots from the mind
the memory of towns, and makes the hearer long to cast his hat
into the sea and join the dwellers in the tents, blended so
inextricably with the shrill cricket&rsquo;s note and the vast
orchestra of the insects that were praising Allah on that night,
each after his own fashion, that it was difficult to say where
the voice ended and the insects&rsquo; hum began.</p>
<p>Still, in despite of all, the singing Arab, croaking of the
frogs, and the shrill p&aelig;ans of the insects, the night
seemed calm and silent, for all the voices were attuned so well
to the <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>surroundings that the serenity of the whole scene was
unimpaired.</p>
<p>The tents lay in the moonlight like gigantic mushrooms; the
rows of bottles cut in blue cloth with which the Arabs ornament
them stood out upon the canvas as if in high relief.&nbsp; The
first light dew was falling, frosting the canvas as a piece of
ice condenses air upon a glass.&nbsp; In a long line before the
tents stood the pack animals munching their corn placed on a
cloth upon the ground.</p>
<p>A dark-grey horse, still with his saddle on for fear of the
night air, was tied near to the door of the chief tent, well in
his owner&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Now and again he pawed the ground,
looked up, and neighed, straining upon the hobbles that confined
his feet fast to the picket line.</p>
<p>On a camp chair his owner sat and smoked, and now and then
half got up from his seat when the horse plunged or any of the
mules stepped on their shackles and nearly fell upon the
ground.</p>
<p>As the Sherif approached he rose to welcome him, listening to
all the reiterated compliments and inquiries that no
self-respecting Arab ever omits when he may chance to meet a
friend.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>A
good address, like mercy, is twice blest, both in the giver and
in the recipient of it; but chiefly it is beneficial to the
giver, for in addition to the pleasure that he gives, he earns
his own respect.&nbsp; Well did both understand this aspect of
the question, and so the compliments stretched out into
perspectives quite unknown in Europe, until the host, taking his
visitor by the hand, led him inside the tent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ambassador,&rdquo; said the Sherif, although he knew his
friend was but a Consul, &ldquo;my heart yearned towards thee, so
I have come to talk with thee of many things, because I know that
thou art wise, not only in the learning of thy people, but in
that of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Consul, not knowing what the real import of the visit
might portend, so to speak felt his adversary&rsquo;s blade,
telling him he was welcome, and that at all times his tent and
house were at the disposition of his friend.&nbsp; Clapping his
hands he called for tea, and when it came, the little flowered
and gold-rimmed glasses, set neatly in a row, the red tin box
with two compartments, one for the tea and one for the blocks of
sugar, the whole surrounding the small dome-shaped pewter teapot,
all placed <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>in order on the heavy copper tray, he waved the
equipage towards the Sherif, tacitly recognising his superiority
in the art of tea-making.&nbsp; Seated beside each other on a
mattress they drank the sacramental three cups of tea, and then,
after the Consul had lit his cigarette, the Sherif having refused
one with a gesture of his hand and a half-murmured
&ldquo;Haram&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;It is
prohibited&rdquo;&mdash;they then began to talk.</p>
<p>Much had they got to say about the price of barley and the
drought; of tribal fights; of where our Lord the Sultan was, and
if he had reduced the rebels in the hills,&mdash;matters that
constitute the small talk of the tents, just as the weather and
the fashionable divorce figure in drawing-rooms.&nbsp; Knowing
what was expected of him, the Consul touched on European
politics, upon inventions, the progress that the French had made
upon the southern frontier of Algeria; and as he thus unpacked
his news with due prolixity, the Sherif now and again interjected
one or another of those pious phrases, such as &ldquo;Allah is
merciful,&rdquo; or &ldquo;God&rsquo;s ways are wonderful,&rdquo;
which at the same time show the interjector&rsquo;s piety, and
give the man <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>who is discoursing time to collect himself, and to
prepare another phrase.</p>
<p>After a little conversation languished, and the two men who
knew each other well sat listlessly, the Consul smoking and the
Sherif passing the beads of a cheap wooden rosary between the
fingers of his right hand, whilst with his left he waved a cotton
pocket handkerchief to keep away the flies.</p>
<p>Looking up at his companion, &ldquo;Consul,&rdquo; he said,
for he had now dropped the Ambassador with which he first had
greeted him, &ldquo;you know us well, you speak our tongue; even
you know Shillah, the language of the accursed Berbers, and have
translated Sidi Hammo into the speech of Nazarenes-I beg your
pardon&mdash;of the Rumi,&rdquo; for he had seen a flush rise on
the Consul&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like our country, and have lived in it for more
than twenty years.&nbsp; I do not speak to you about our law, for
every man cleaves to his own, but of our daily life.&nbsp; Tell
me now, which of the two makes a man happier, the law of Sidna
Aissa, or that of our Prophet, God&rsquo;s own
Messenger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and waited courteously, playing <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>with his
naked toes, just as a European plays with his fingers in the
intervals of speech.</p>
<p>The Consul sent a veritable solfatara of tobacco smoke out of
his mouth and nostrils, and laying down his cigarette returned no
answer for a little while.</p>
<p>Perchance his thoughts were wandering towards the cities
brilliant with light&mdash;the homes of science and of art.&nbsp;
Cities of vain endeavour in which men pass their lives thinking
of the condition of their poorer brethren, but never making any
move to get down off their backs.&nbsp; He thought of London and
of Paris and New York, the dwelling-places both of law and order,
and the abodes of noise.&nbsp; He pondered on their material
advancement: their tubes that burrow underneath the ground, in
which run railways carrying their thousands all the day and far
into the night; upon their hospitals, their charitable
institutions, their legislative assemblies, and their museums,
with their picture-galleries, their theatres&mdash;on the vast
sums bestowed to forward arts and sciences, and on the poor who
shiver in their streets and cower under railway arches in the
dark winter nights.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>As he
sat with his cigarette smouldering beside him in a little brazen
pan, the night breeze brought the heavy scent of orange blossoms,
for it was spring, and all the gardens of the sanctuary each had
its orange grove.&nbsp; Never had they smelt sweeter, and never
had the croaking of the frogs seemed more melodious, or the
cricket&rsquo;s chirp more soothing to the soul.</p>
<p>A death&rsquo;s-head moth whirred through the tent, poising
itself, just as a humming-bird hangs stationary probing the
petals of a flower.&nbsp; The gentle murmur of its wings brought
back the Consul&rsquo;s mind from its excursus in the regions of
reality, or unreality, for all is one according to the point of
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherif,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what you have asked me I
will answer to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s destiny is so precarious that neither your
law nor our own appear to me to influence it, or at the best but
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your learned Talebs, or our men of science, as
they call themselves, with the due modesty of conscious worth, is
passing down a street, and from a house-top slips a tile and
falls upon his head.&nbsp; There he lies huddled up, an ugly
bundle of old clothes, inert and <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>shapeless, whilst his immortal soul
leaves his poor mortal body, without which all its divinity is
incomplete; then perhaps after an hour comes back again, and the
man staggering to his feet begins to talk about God&rsquo;s
attributes, or about carrying a line of railroad along a
precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sherif, who had been listening with the respect that every
well-bred Arab gives to the man who has possession of the word,
said, &ldquo;It was so written.&nbsp; The man could not have died
or never could have come to life again had it not been
Allah&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend smiled grimly and rejoined, &ldquo;That is so; but
as Allah never manifests his will, except in action, just as we
act towards a swarm of ants, annihilating some and sparing others
as we pass, it does not matter very much what Allah thinks about,
as it regards ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was young,&rdquo; slowly said the Sherif,
&ldquo;whilst in the slave trade far away beyond the desert, I
met the pagan tribes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had no God . . . like Christians. . .&nbsp; Pardon
me, I know you know our phrase: nothing but images of wood.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;Those infidels, who, by the way, were just as
apt at a good bargain as if their fathers all had bowed
themselves in Christian temple or in mosque, when they received
no answer to their prayers, would pull their accursed images down
from their shrines, paint them jet black, and hang them from a
nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathens they were, ignorant even of the name of God,
finding their heaven and their hell here upon earth, just like
the animals, but . . . sometimes I have thought not quite bereft
of reason, for they had not the difficulties you have about the
will of Allah and the way in which he works.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made their gods themselves, just as we do,&rdquo;
and as he spoke he lowered his voice and peered out of the tent
door; &ldquo;but wiser than ourselves they kept a tight hand on
them, and made their will, as far as possible, coincide with
their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the hour of prayer. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pleasantly the time passes away conversing with
one&rsquo;s friends&rdquo;; and as he spoke he stood erect,
turning towards Mecca, as mechanically as the needle turns
towards the pole.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>His
whole appearance altered and his mean presence suffered a subtle
change.&nbsp; With eyes fixed upon space, and hands uplifted, he
testified to the existence of the one God, the Compassionate, the
Merciful, the Bounteous, the Generous One, who alone giveth
victory.</p>
<p>Then, sinking down, he laid his forehead on the ground,
bringing his palms together.&nbsp; Three times he bowed himself,
and then rising again upon his feet recited the confession of his
faith.</p>
<p>The instant he had done he sat him down again; but gravely and
with the air of one who has performed an action, half courteous,
half obligatory, but refreshing to the soul.</p>
<p>The Consul, who well knew his ways, and knew that probably he
seldom prayed at home, and that the prayers he had just seen most
likely were a sort of affirmation of his neutral attitude before
a stranger, yet was interested.</p>
<p>Then, when the conversation was renewed, he said to him,
&ldquo;Prayer seems to me, Sherif, to be the one great difference
between the animals and man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the rest, we live and die, drink, eat, and
propagate our species, just as they do; <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>but no one
ever heard of any animal who had addressed himself to
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile flitted across the pock-marked features of the
descendant of the Prophet, and looking gravely at his
friend,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Allah to you has given
many things.&nbsp; He has endowed you with your fertile brains,
that have searched into forces which had remained unknown in
nature since the sons of Adam first trod the surface of the
earth.&nbsp; All that you touch you turn to gold, and as our
saying goes, &lsquo;Gold builds a bridge across the
sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ships, aeroplanes, cannons of monstrous size, and
little instruments by which you see minutest specks as if they
were great rocks; all these you have and yet you doubt His
power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To us, the Arabs, we who came from the lands of fire in
the Hejaz and Hadramut.&nbsp; We who for centuries have remained
unchanged, driving our camels as our fathers drove them, eating
and drinking as our fathers ate and drank, and living face to
face with God. . . .&nbsp; Consu&rsquo;, you should not smile,
for do we not live closer to Him than you do, under the stars <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>at night,
out in the sun by day, our lives almost as simple as the lives of
animals?&nbsp; To us He has vouchsafed gifts that He either has
withheld from you, or that you have neglected in your pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus we still keep our faith. . . .&nbsp; Faith in the
God who set the planets in their courses, bridled the tides, and
caused the palm to grow beside the river so that the traveller
may rest beneath its shade, and resting, praise His name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me, who ever heard of any animal that addressed
himself to God.&nbsp; He in His infinite power . . . be sure of
it . . . is He not merciful and compassionate, wonderful in His
ways, harder to follow than the track that a gazelle leaves in
the desert sands; it cannot be that He could have denied them
access to His ear?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not the lizard, Consul . . ., Hamed el Angri, the
runner, the man who never can rest long in any place, but must be
ever tightening his belt and pulling up his slippers at the heel
to make ready for the road . . ., did he not tell you of El
Hokaitsallah, the little lizard who, being late upon the day when
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Allah
took away speech from all the animals, ran on the beam in the
great mosque at Mecca, and dumbly scratched his
prayer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Consul nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hamed el Angri,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;no doubt is still upon the road, by whose side he
will die one day of hunger or of thirst. . . .&nbsp; Yes; he told
me of it, and I wrote it in a book. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write this, then,&rdquo; the Sherif went on,
&ldquo;Allah in his compassion, and in case the animals, bereft
of speech, that is in Arabic, for each has his own tongue, should
not be certain of the direction of the Kiblah, has given the
power to a poor insect which we call El Masgad to pray for all of
them.&nbsp; With its head turned to Mecca, as certainly as if he
had the needle of the mariners, he prays at El Magreb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day he sits erect and watches for his prey.&nbsp;
At eventide, just at the hour of El Magreb, when from the
&lsquo;alminares&rsquo; of the Mosques the muezzin calls upon the
faithful for their prayers, he adds his testimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consu&rsquo;, Allah rejects no prayer, however humble,
and that the little creature knows.&nbsp; He knows that Allah
does not answer every prayer; <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>but yet the prayer remains; it is
not blotted out, and perhaps some day it may fructify, for it is
written in the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore El Masgad prays each night for all the
animals, yet being but a little thing and simple, it has not
strength to testify at all the hours laid down in Mecca by our
Lord Mohammed, he of the even teeth, the curling hair, and the
grave smile, that never left his face after he had communed with
Allah in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Consul dropped his smoked-out cigarette, and, stretching
over to his friend, held out his hand to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherif,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe El Masgad prays
for you and me, as well as for its kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came: &ldquo;Consu&rsquo;, doubt not; it is a
little animal of God, . . . we too are in His hand. . .

164</span>XIV<br />
FEAST DAY IN SANTA MARIA MAYOR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great Capilla, the largest in
the Jesuit Reductions of Paraguay, was built round a huge square,
almost a quarter of a mile across.</p>
<p>Upon three sides ran the low, continuous line of houses, like
a &ldquo;row&rdquo; in a Scotch mining village or a phalanstery
designed by Prudhon or St. Simon in their treatises; but by the
grace of a kind providence never carried out, either in bricks or
stone.</p>
<p>Each dwelling-place was of the same design and size as all the
rest.&nbsp; Rough tiles made in the Jesuit times, but now
weathered and broken, showing the rafters tied with raw hide in
many places, formed the long roof, that looked a little like the
pent-house of a tennis court.</p>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>A
deep verandah ran in front, stretching from one end to the other
of the square, supported on great balks of wood, which, after
more than two hundred years and the assaults of weather and the
all-devouring ants, still showed the adze marks where they had
been dressed.&nbsp; The timber was so hard that you could
scarcely drive a nail into it, despite the flight of time since
it was first set up.&nbsp; Rings fixed about six feet from the
ground were screwed into the pillars of the verandah, before
every door, to fasten horses to, exactly as they are in an old
Spanish town.</p>
<p>Against the wall of almost every house, just by the door, was
set a chair or two of heavy wood, with the seat formed by strips
of hide, on which the hair had formerly been left, but long ago
rubbed off by use, or eaten by the ants.</p>
<p>The owner of the house sat with the back of the strong chair
tilted against the wall, dressed in a loose and pleated shirt,
with a high turned-down collar open at the throat, and spotless
white duck trousers, that looked the whiter by their contrast
with his brown, naked feet.</p>
<p>His home-made palm-tree hat was placed <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>upon the
ground beside him, and his cloak of coarse red baize was thrown
back from his shoulders, as he sat smoking a cigarette rolled in
a maize leaf, for in the Jesuit capillas only women smoked
cigars.</p>
<p>At every angle of the square a sandy trail led out, either to
the river or the woods, the little patches planted with mandioca,
or to the maze of paths that, like the points outside a junction,
eventually joined in one main trail, that ran from Itapua on the
Paran&aacute;, up to Asuncion.</p>
<p>The church, built of wood cut in the neighbouring forest, had
two tall towers, and followed in its plan the pattern of all the
churches in the New World built by the Jesuits, from California
down to the smallest mission in the south.&nbsp; It filled the
fourth side of the square, and on each side of it there rose two
feathery palms, known as the tallest in the Missions, which
served as landmarks for travellers coming to the place, if they
had missed their road.&nbsp; So large and well-proportioned was
the church, it seemed impossible that it had been constructed
solely by the Indians themselves, under the direction of the
missionaries.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>The
overhanging porch and flight of steps that ran down to the grassy
sward in the middle of the town gave it an air as of a cathedral
reared to nature in the wilds, for the thick jungle flowed up
behind it and almost touched its walls.</p>
<p>Bells of great size, either cast upon the spot or brought at
vast expense from Spain, hung in the towers.&nbsp; On this, the
feast day of the Blessed Virgin, the special patron of the
settlement, they jangled ceaselessly, the Indians taking turns to
haul upon the dried lianas that served instead of ropes.&nbsp;
Though they pulled vigorously, the bells sounded a little
muffled, as if they strove in vain against the vigorous nature
that rendered any work of man puny and insignificant in the
Paraguayan wilds.</p>
<p>Inside, the fane was dark, the images of saints were dusty,
their paint was cracked, their gilding tarnished, making them
look a little like the figures in a New Zealand pah, as they
loomed through the darkness of the aisle.&nbsp; On the neglected
altar, for at that time priests were a rarity in the Reductions,
the Indians had placed great bunches of red flowers, and now and
then a humming-bird flitted in through <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the
glassless windows and hung poised above them; then darted out
again, with a soft, whirring sound.&nbsp; Over the whole capilla,
in which at one time several thousand Indians had lived, but now
reduced to seventy or eighty at the most, there hung an air of
desolation.&nbsp; It seemed as if man, in his long protracted
struggle with the forces of the woods, had been defeated, and had
accepted his defeat, content to vegetate, forgotten by the world,
in the vast sea of green.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the annual festival of the Blessed
Virgin, there was an air of animation, for from far and near,
from Jesuit capilla, from straw-thatched huts lost in the
clearings of the primeval forest, from the few cattle ranches
that then existed, and from the little town of Itapua, fifty
miles away, the scanty population had turned out to attend the
festival.</p>
<p>Upon the forest tracks, from earliest dawn, long lines of
white-clad women, barefooted, with their black hair cut square
across the forehead and hanging down their backs, had marched as
silently as ghosts.&nbsp; All of them smoked great, green cigars,
and as they <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>marched along, their leader carrying a torch, till the
sun rose and jaguars went back to their lairs, they never talked;
but if a woman in the rear of the long line wished to converse
with any comrade in the front she trotted forward till she
reached her friend and whispered in her ear.&nbsp; When they
arrived at the crossing of the little river they bathed, or, at
the least, washed carefully, and gathering a bunch of flowers,
stuck them into their hair.&nbsp; They crossed the stream, and on
arriving at the plaza they set the baskets, which they had
carried on their heads, upon the ground, and sitting down beside
them on the grass, spread out their merchandise.&nbsp; Oranges
and bread, called &ldquo;chipa,&rdquo; made from mandioca flour
and cheese, with vegetables and various homely sweetmeats, ground
nuts, rolls of sugar done up in plaintain leaves, and known as
&ldquo;rapadura,&rdquo; were the chief staples of their
trade.&nbsp; Those who had asses let them loose to feed; and if
upon the forest trails the women had been silent, once in the
safety of the town no flight of parrots in a maize field could
have chattered louder than they did as they sat waiting by their
wares.&nbsp; Soon the square filled, and men <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>arriving
tied their horses in the shade, slackening their broad hide
girths, and piling up before them heaps of the leaves of the palm
called &ldquo;Pind&oacute;&rdquo; in Guarani, till they were cool
enough to eat their corn.&nbsp; Bands of boys, for in those days
most of the men had been killed off in the past war, came
trooping in, accompanied by crowds of women and of girls, who
carried all their belongings, for there were thirteen women to a
man, and the youngest boy was at a premium amongst the Indian
women, who in the villages, where hardly any men were left,
fought for male stragglers like unchained tigresses.&nbsp; A few
old men came riding in on some of the few native horses left, for
almost all the active, little, undersized breed of Paraguay had
been exhausted in the war.&nbsp; They, too, had bands of women
trotting by their sides, all of them anxious to unsaddle, to take
the horses down to bathe, or to perform any small office that the
men required of them.&nbsp; All of them smoked continuously, and
each of them was ready with a fresh cigarette as soon as the old
man or boy whom they accompanied finished the stump he held
between his lips.&nbsp; The women <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>all were dressed in the long Indian
shirt called a &ldquo;tupoi,&rdquo; cut rather low upon the
breast, and edged with coarse black cotton lace, which every
Paraguayan woman wore.&nbsp; Their hair was as black as a
crow&rsquo;s back, and quite as shiny, and their white teeth so
strong that they could tear the ears of corn out of a maize cob
like a horse munching at his corn.</p>
<p>Then a few Correntino gauchos next appeared, dressed in their
national costume of loose black merino trousers, stuffed into
long boots, whose fronts were all embroidered in red silk.&nbsp;
Their silver spurs, whose rowels were as large as saucers, just
dangled off their heels, only retained in place by a flat chain,
that met upon the instep, clasped with a lion&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
Long hair and brown vicuna ponchos, soft black felt hats, and red
silk handkerchiefs tied loosely round their necks marked them as
strangers, though they spoke Guarani.</p>
<p>They sat upon their silver-mounted saddles, with their toes
resting in their bell-shaped stirrups, swaying so easily with
every movement that the word riding somehow or other seemed
inapplicable to men who, like the centaurs, formed one body with
the horse.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>As
they drew near the plaza they raised their hands and touched
their horses with the spur, and, rushing like a whirlwind right
to the middle of the square, drew up so suddenly that their
horses seemed to have turned to statues for a moment, and then at
a slow trot, that made their silver trappings jingle as they
went, slowly rode off into the shade.</p>
<p>The plaza filled up imperceptibly, and the short grass was
covered by a white-clad throng of Indians.&nbsp; The heat
increased, and all the time the bells rang out, pulled vigorously
by relays of Indians, and at a given signal the people turned and
trooped towards the church, all carrying flowers in their
hands.</p>
<p>As there was no one to sing Mass, and as the organ long had
been neglected, the congregation listened to some prayers, read
from a book of Hours by an old Indian, who pronounced the Latin,
of which most likely he did not understand a word, as if it had
been Guarani.&nbsp; They sang &ldquo;Las Flores &aacute;
Maria&rdquo; all in unison, but keeping such good time that at a
little distance from the church it sounded like waves breaking on
a beach after a summer storm.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>In
the neglected church, where no priest ministered or clergy
prayed, where all the stoops of holy water had for years been
dry, and where the Mass had been well-nigh forgotten as a whole,
the spirit lingered, and if it quickeneth upon that feast day in
the Paraguayan missions, that simple congregation were as
uplifted by it as if the sacrifice had duly been fulfilled with
candles, incense, and the pomp and ceremony of Holy Mother Church
upon the Seven Hills.</p>
<p>As every one except the Correntinos went barefooted, the exit
of the congregation made no noise except the sound of naked feet,
slapping a little on the wooden steps, and so the people silently
once again filled the plaza, where a high wooden arch had been
erected in the middle, for the sport of running at the ring.</p>
<p>The vegetable sellers had now removed from the middle of the
square, taking all their wares under the long verandah, and
several pedlars had set up their booths and retailed cheap
European trifles such as no one in the world but a Paraguayan
Indian could possibly require.&nbsp; Razors that would not cut,
and little looking-glasses in pewter frames made in <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>Thuringia,
cheap clocks that human ingenuity was powerless to repair when
they had run their course of six months&rsquo; intermittent
ticking, and gaudy pictures representing saints who had ascended
to the empyrean, as it appeared, with the clothes that they had
worn in life, and all bald-headed, as befits a saint, were set
out side by side with handkerchiefs of the best China silk.&nbsp;
Sales were concluded after long-continued chaffering&mdash;that
higgling of the market dear to old-time economists, for no one
would have bought the smallest article, even below cost price,
had it been offered to him at the price the seller originally
asked.</p>
<p>Enrique Clerici, from Itapua, had transported all his pulperia
bodily for the occasion of the feast.&nbsp; It had not wanted
more than a small wagon to contain his stock-in-trade.&nbsp; Two
or three dozen bottles of square-faced gin of the Anchor brand, a
dozen of heady red wine from Catalonia, a pile of sardine boxes,
sweet biscuits, raisins from Malaga, esparto baskets full of
figs, and sundry pecks of apricots dried in the sun and cut into
the shape of ears, and hence called &ldquo;orejones,&rdquo;
completed all his store.&nbsp; He himself, tall and <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>sunburnt,
stood dressed in riding-boots and a broad hat, with his revolver
in his belt, beside a pile of empty bottles, which he had always
ready, to hurl at customers if there should be any attempt either
at cheating or to rush his wares.&nbsp; He spoke the curious
lingo, half-Spanish, half-Italian, that so many of his countrymen
use in the River Plate; and all his conversation ran upon
Garibaldi, with whom he had campaigned in youth, upon Italia
Irredenta, and on the time when anarchy should sanctify mankind
by blood, as he said, and bring about the reign of universal
brotherhood.</p>
<p>He did a roaring trade, despite the competition of a native
Paraguayan, who had brought three demi-johns of Ca&ntilde;a, for
men prefer the imported article the whole world over, though it
is vile, to native manufactures, even when cheap and good.</p>
<p>Just about twelve o&rsquo;clock, when the sun almost burned a
hole into one&rsquo;s head, the band got ready in the church
porch, playing upon old instruments, some of which may have
survived from Jesuit times, or, at the least, been copied in the
place, as the originals decayed.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Sackbuts and psalteries and shawms were there, with
serpents, gigantic clarionets, and curiously twisted oboes, and
drums, whose canvas all hung slack and gave a muffled sound when
they were beaten, and little fifes, ear-piercing and devilish,
were represented in that band.&nbsp; It banged and crashed
&ldquo;La Palomita,&rdquo; that tune of evil-sounding omen, for
to its strains prisoners were always ushered out to execution in
the times of Lopez, and as it played the players slowly walked
down the steps.</p>
<p>Behind them followed the alcalde, an aged Indian, dressed in
long cotton drawers, that at the knees were split into a fringe
that hung down to his ankles, a spotless shirt much pleated, and
a red cloak of fine merino cloth.&nbsp; In his right hand he
carried a long cane with a silver head&mdash;his badge of
office.&nbsp; Walking up to the door of his own house, by which
was set a table covered with glasses and with homemade cakes, he
gave the signal for the running at the ring.</p>
<p>The Correntino gauchos, two or three Paraguayans, and a German
married to a Paraguayan wife, were all who entered for the <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>sport.&nbsp; The band struck up, and a young Paraguayan
started the first course.&nbsp; Gripping his stirrups tightly
between his naked toes, and seated on an old &ldquo;recao,&rdquo;
surmounted by a sheepskin, he spurred his horse, a wall-eyed
skewbald, with his great iron spurs, tied to his bare insteps
with thin strips of hide.&nbsp; The skewbald, only half-tamed,
reared once or twice and bounded off, switching its ragged tail,
which had been half-eaten off by cows.&nbsp; The people yelled, a
&ldquo;mosqueador!&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a
&ldquo;fly-flapper,&rdquo; a grave fault in a horse in the eyes
of Spanish Americans&mdash;as the Paraguayan steered the skewbald
with the reins held high in his left hand, carrying the other
just above the level of his eyes, armed with a piece of cane
about a foot in length.</p>
<p>As he approached the arch, in which the ring dangled from a
string, his horse, either frightened by the shouting of the crowd
or by the arch itself, swerved and plunged violently, carrying
its rider through the thickest of the people, who separated like
a flock of sheep when a dog runs through it, cursing him
volubly.&nbsp; The German came the next, dressed in his Sunday
clothes, a slop-made suit of shoddy <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>cloth, riding a horse that all his
spurring could not get into full speed.&nbsp; The rider&rsquo;s
round, fair face was burned a brick-dust colour, and as he
spurred and plied his whip, made out of solid tapir hide, the
sweat ran down in streams upon his coat.&nbsp; So intent was he
on flogging, that as he neared the ring he dropped his piece of
cane, and his horse, stopping suddenly just underneath the arch,
would have unseated him had he not clasped it round the
neck.&nbsp; Shouts of delight greeted this feat of horsemanship,
and one tall Correntino, taking his cigarette out of his mouth,
said to his fellow sitting next to him upon his horse, &ldquo;The
very animals themselves despise the gringos.&nbsp; See how that
little white-nosed brute that he was riding knew that he was a
&lsquo;maturango,&rsquo; and nearly had him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next came Hijinio Rojas, a Paraguayan of the better classes,
sallow and Indian looking, dressed in clothes bought in Asuncion,
his trousers tucked into his riding-boots.&nbsp; His small black
hat, with the brim flattened up against his head by the wind
caused by the fury of the gallop of his active little roan with
four white feet, was kept upon his head by a <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>black
ribbon knotted underneath his chin.&nbsp; As he neared the arch
his horse stepped double several times and fly jumped; but that
did not disturb him in the least, and, aiming well he touched the
ring, making it fly into the air.&nbsp; A shout went up, partly
in Spanish, partly in Guarani, from the assembled people, and
Rojas, reining in his horse, stopped him in a few bounds, so
sharply, that his unshod feet cut up the turf of the green plaza
as a skate cuts the ice.&nbsp; He turned and trotted gently to
the arch, and then, putting his horse to its top speed, stopped
it again beside the other riders, amid the &ldquo;Vivas&rdquo; of
the crowd.&nbsp; Then came the turn of the four Correntinos, who
rode good horses from their native province, had silver
horse-gear and huge silver spurs, that dangled from their
heels.&nbsp; They were all gauchos, born, as the saying goes,
&ldquo;amongst the animals.&rdquo;&nbsp; A dun with fiery eyes
and a black stripe right down his back, and with black markings
on both hocks, a chestnut skewbald, a &ldquo;doradillo,&rdquo;
and a horse of that strange mealy bay with a fern-coloured
muzzle, that the gauchos call a &ldquo;Pangar&eacute;,&rdquo;
carried them just as if their will and that of those who <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>rode them
were identical.&nbsp; Without a signal, visible at least to any
but themselves, their horses started at full speed, reaching
occasionally at the bit, then dropping it again and bridling so
easy that one could ride them with a thread drawn from a
spider&rsquo;s web.&nbsp; Their riders sat up easily, not riding
as a European rides, with his eyes fixed upon each movement of
his horse, but, as it were, divining them as soon as they were
made.&nbsp; Each of them took the ring, and all of them checked
their horses, as it were, by their volition, rather than the bit,
making the silver horse-gear rattle and their great silver spurs
jingle upon their feet.&nbsp; Each waited for the other at the
far side of the arch, and then turning in a line they started
with a shout, and as they passed right through the middle of the
square at a wild gallop, they swung down sideways from their
saddles and dragged their hands upon the ground.&nbsp; Swinging
up, apparently without an effort, back into their seats, when
they arrived at the point from where they had first started, they
reined up suddenly, making their horses plunge and rear, and then
by a light signal on the reins stand quietly in line, tossing the
foam <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>into the air.&nbsp; Hijinio Rojas and the four centaurs
all received a prize, and the alcalde, pouring out wineglasses
full of gin, handed them to the riders, who, with a compliment or
two as to the order of their drinking, emptied them solemnly.</p>
<p>No other runners having come forward to compete, for in those
days horses were scarce throughout the Paraguayan Missions, the
sports were over, and the perspiring crowd went off to breakfast
at tables spread under the long verandahs, and silence fell upon
the square.</p>
<p>The long, hot hours during the middle of the day were passed
in sleeping.&nbsp; Some lay face downwards in the shade.&nbsp;
Others swung in white cotton hammocks, keeping them in perpetual
motion, till they fell asleep, by pushing with a naked toe upon
the ground.&nbsp; At last the sun, the enemy, as the Arabs call
him, slowly declined, and white-robed women, with their
&ldquo;tupois&rdquo; slipping half off their necks, began to come
out into the verandahs, slack and perspiring after the midday
struggle with the heat.</p>
<p>Then bands of girls sauntered down to the <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>river, from
whence soon came the sound of merry laughter as they splashed
about and bathed.</p>
<p>The Correntinos rode down to a pool and washed their horses,
throwing the water on them with their two hands, as the animals
stood nervously shrinking from each splash, until they were quite
wet through and running down, when they stood quietly, with their
tails tucked in between their legs.</p>
<p>Night came on, as it does in those latitudes, no twilight
intervening, and from the rows of houses came the faint lights of
wicks burning in bowls of grease, whilst from beneath the orange
trees was heard the tinkling of guitars.</p>
<p>Enormous bats soared about noiselessly, and white-dressed
couples lingered about the corners of the streets, and men stood
talking, pressed closely up against the wooden gratings of the
windows, to women hidden inside the room.&nbsp; The air was heavy
with the languorous murmur of the tropic night, and gradually the
lights one by one were extinguished, and the tinkling of the
guitars was stilled.&nbsp; The moon came out, serene and
glorious, showing <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>each stone upon the sandy trails as clearly as at
midday.&nbsp; Saddling their horses, the four Correntinos
silently struck the trail to Itapua, and bands of women moved off
along the forest tracks towards their homes, walking in Indian
file.&nbsp; Hijinio Rojas, who had saddled up to put the
Correntinos on the right road, emerged into the moonlit plaza,
his shadow outlined so sharply on the grass it seemed it had been
drawn, and then, entering a side street, disappeared into the
night.&nbsp; The shrill neighing of his horse appeared as if it
bade farewell to its companions, now far away upon the Itapua
trail.&nbsp; Noises that rise at night from forests in the
tropics sound mysteriously, deep in the woods.&nbsp; It seemed as
if a population silent by day was active and on foot, and from
the underwood a thick white mist arose, shrouding the sleeping
town.</p>
<p>Little by little, just as a rising tide covers a reef of
rocks, it submerged everything in its white, clinging
folds.&nbsp; The houses disappeared, leaving the plaza seething
like a lake, and then the church was swallowed up, the towers
struggling, as it were, a little, just as a wreath of seaweed on
a rock appears to fight against <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>the tide.&nbsp; Then they too
disappeared, and the conquering mist enveloped everything.&nbsp;
All that was left above the sea of billowing white were the two
topmost tufts of the tall, feathery palms.</p>
<h2><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>XV<br />
BOPICU&Aacute;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great corral at Bopicu&aacute;
was full of horses.&nbsp; Greys, browns, bays, blacks, duns,
chestnuts, roans (both blue and red), skewbalds and piebalds,
with claybanks, calicos, buckskins, and a hundred shades and
markings, unknown in Europe, but each with its proper name in
Uruguay and Argentina, jostled each other, forming a
kaleidoscopic mass.</p>
<p>A thick dust rose from the corral and hung above their
heads.&nbsp; Sometimes the horses stood all huddled up, gazing
with wide distended eyes and nostrils towards a group of men that
lounged about the gate.&nbsp; At other times that panic fear that
seizes upon horses when they are crushed together in large
numbers, set them a-galloping.&nbsp; Through the dust-cloud their
footfalls sounded muffled, <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>and they themselves appeared like
phantoms in a mist.&nbsp; When they had circled round a little
they stopped, and those outside the throng, craning their heads
down nearly to the ground, snorted, and then ran back, arching
their necks and carrying their tails like flags.&nbsp; Outside
the great corral was set Parodi&rsquo;s camp, below some China
trees, and formed of corrugated iron and hides, stuck on short
uprights, so that the hides and iron almost came down upon the
ground, in gipsy fashion.&nbsp; Upon the branches of the trees
were hung saddles, bridles, halters, hobbles, lazos, and
boleadoras, and underneath were spread out saddle-cloths to
dry.&nbsp; Pieces of meat swung from the low gables of the hut,
and under the low eaves was placed a &ldquo;catre,&rdquo; the
canvas scissor-bedstead of Spain and of her colonies in the New
World.&nbsp; Upon the catre was a heap of ponchos, airing in the
sun, their bright and startling colours looking almost dingy in
the fierce light of a March afternoon in Uruguay.&nbsp; Close to
the camp stood several bullock-carts, their poles supported on a
crutch, and their reed-covered tilts giving them an air of huts
on wheels.&nbsp; <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>Men sat about on bullocks&rsquo; skulls, around a
smouldering fire, whilst the &ldquo;mat&eacute;&rdquo; circulated
round from man to man, after the fashion of a loving-cup.&nbsp;
Parodi, the stiff-jointed son of Italian parents, a gaucho as to
clothes and speech, but still half-European in his lack of
comprehension of the ways of a wild horse.&nbsp; Arena, the
capataz from Entre-Rios, thin, slight, and nervous, a man who
had, as he said, in his youth known how to read and even guide
the pen; but now &ldquo;things of this world had turned him quite
unlettered, and made him more familiar with the lazo and the
spurs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mulatto Pablo Suarez, active and
cat-like, a great race-rider and horse-tamer, short and
deep-chested, with eyes like those of a black cat, and toes,
prehensile as a monkey&rsquo;s, that clutched the stirrup when a
wild colt began to buck, so that it could not touch its
flanks.&nbsp; They and Miguel Paralelo, tall, dark, and handsome,
the owner of some property, but drawn by the excitement of a
cowboy&rsquo;s life to work for wages, so that he could enjoy the
risk of venturing his neck each day on a
&ldquo;bagu&aacute;l,&rdquo; <a name="citation187"></a><a
href="#footnote187" class="citation">[187]</a> with other peons
as <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>El
Correntino and Venancio Baez, were grouped around the fire.&nbsp;
With them were seated Martin el Madrile&ntilde;o, a Spanish
horse-coper, who had experienced the charm of gaucho life,
together with Silvestre Ayres, a Brazilian, slight and
olive-coloured, well-educated, but better known as a dead
pistol-shot than as man of books.&nbsp; They waited for their
turn at mat&eacute;, or ate great chunks of meat from a roast
cooked upon a spit, over a fire of bones.&nbsp; Most of the men
were tall and sinewy, with that air of taciturnity and
self-equilibrium that their isolated lives and Indian blood so
often stamp upon the faces of those centaurs of the plains.&nbsp;
The camp, set on a little hill, dominated the country for miles
on every side.&nbsp; Just underneath it, horses and more horses
grazed.&nbsp; Towards the west it stretched out to the woods that
fringe the Uruguay, which, with its countless islands, flowed
between great tracks of forest, and formed the frontier with the
Argentine.</p>
<p>Between the camp and the corrals smouldered a fire of bones
and &ntilde;andubay, and by it, leaning up against a rail, were
set the branding-irons that had turned the horses in the corral
<a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>into the
property of the British Government.&nbsp; All round the herd
enclosed, ran horses neighing, seeking their companions, who were
to graze no more at Bopicu&aacute;, but be sent off by train and
ship to the battlefields of Europe to die and suffer, for they
knew not what, leaving their pastures and their innocent
comradeship with one another till the judgment day.&nbsp; Then, I
am sure, for God must have some human feeling after all, things
will be explained to them, light come into their semi-darkness,
and they will feed in prairies where the grass fades not, and
springs are never dry, freed from the saddle, and with no cruel
spur to urge them on they know not where or why.</p>
<p>For weeks we had been choosing out the doomed five
hundred.&nbsp; Riding, inspecting, and examining from dawn till
evening, till it appeared that not a single equine imperfection
could have escaped our eyes.&nbsp; The gauchos, who all think
that they alone know anything about a horse, were all struck dumb
with sheer amazement.&nbsp; It seemed to them astonishing to take
such pains to select horses that for the most part would be
killed in a few months.&nbsp; <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>&ldquo;These men,&rdquo; they said,
&ldquo;certainly all are doctors at the job.&nbsp; They know even
the least defect, can tell what a horse thinks about and
why.&nbsp; Still, none of them can ride a horse if he but shakes
his ears.&nbsp; In their bag surely there is a cat shut up of
some kind or another.&nbsp; If not, why do they bother so much in
the matter, when all that is required is something that can carry
one into the thickest of the fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun began to slant a little, and we had still three
leagues to drive the horses to the pasture where they had to pass
the night for the last time in freedom, before they were
entrained.&nbsp; Our horses stood outside of the corral, tied to
the posts, some saddled with the &ldquo;recado,&rdquo; <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a> its heads adorned with silver, some
with the English saddle, that out of England has such a strange,
unserviceable look, much like a saucepan on a horse&rsquo;s
back.&nbsp; Just as we were about to mount, a man appeared,
driving a point of horses, which, he said, &ldquo;to leave would
be a crime against the sacrament.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;These are
all pingos,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;fit for the saddle of the
Lord on High, all of them <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>are bitted in the Brazilian style,
can turn upon a spread-out saddle-cloth, and all of them can
gallop round a bullock&rsquo;s head upon the ground, so that the
rider can keep his hand upon it all the time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
speaker by his accent was a Brazilian.&nbsp; His face was
olive-coloured, his hair had the suspicion of a kink.&nbsp; His
horse, a cream-colour, with black tail and mane, was evidently
only half-tamed, and snorted loudly as it bounded here and there,
making its silver harness jingle and the rider&rsquo;s poncho
flutter in the air.&nbsp; Although time pressed, the man&rsquo;s
address was so persuasive, his appearance so much in character
with his great silver spurs just hanging from his heel, his
jacket turned up underneath his elbow by the handle of his knife,
and, to speak truth, the horses looked so good and in such high
condition that we determined to examine them, and told their
owner to drive them into a corral.</p>
<p>Once again we commenced the work that we had done so many
times of mounting and examining.&nbsp; Once more we fought,
trying to explain the mysteries of red tape to unsophisticated
minds, and once again our &ldquo;domadores&rdquo; sprang lightly,
barebacked, upon the horses <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>they had never seen before, with
varying results.&nbsp; Some of the Brazilian&rsquo;s horses
bucked like antelopes, El Correntino and the others of our men
sitting them barebacked as easily as an ordinary man rides over a
small fence.&nbsp; To all our queries why they did not saddle up
we got one answer, &ldquo;To ride with the recado is but a
pastime only fit for boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they went on, pulling
the horses up in three short bounds, nostrils aflame and tails
and manes tossed wildly in the air, only a yard or two from the
corral.&nbsp; Then, slipping off, gave their opinion that the
particular &ldquo;bayo,&rdquo; &ldquo;zaino,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;gateao&rdquo; was just the thing to mount a lancer on, and
that the speaker thought he could account for a good tale of
Boches if he were over there in the Great War.&nbsp; This same
great war, which they called &ldquo;barbarous,&rdquo; taking a
secret pleasure in the fact that it showed Europeans not a whit
more civilised than they themselves, appeared to them something
in the way of a great pastime from which they were debarred.</p>
<p>Most of them, when they sold a horse, looked at him and
remarked, &ldquo;Pobrecito, you will go to the Great War,&rdquo;
just as a man looks <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>at his son who is about to go, with
feelings of mixed admiration and regret.</p>
<p>After we had examined all the Brazilian&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tropilla&rdquo; so carefully that he said, &ldquo;By
Satan&rsquo;s death, your graces know far more about my horses
than I myself, and all I wonder is that you do not ask me if all
of them have not complied with all the duties of the
Church,&rdquo; we found that about twenty of them were fit for
the Great War.&nbsp; Calling upon Parodi and the capataz of
Bopicu&aacute;, who all the time had remained seated round the
smouldering fire and drinking mat&eacute;, to prepare the
branding-irons, the peons led them off, our head man calling out
&ldquo;Artilleria&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caballeria,&rdquo; according
to their size.&nbsp; After the branding, either on the hip for
cavalry and on the neck for the artillery, a peon cut their manes
off, making them as ugly as a mule, as their late owner said, and
we were once more ready for the road, after the payment had been
made.&nbsp; This took a little time, either because the Brazilian
could not count, or perhaps because of his great caution, for he
would not take payment except horse by horse.&nbsp; So, driving
out the horses one by one, <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>we placed a roll of dollars in his
hand as each one passed the gate.&nbsp; Even then each roll of
dollars had to be counted separately, for time is what men have
the most at their disposal in places such as Bopicu&aacute;.</p>
<p>Two hours of sunset still remained, with three long leagues to
cover, for in those latitudes there is no twilight, night
succeeding day, just as films follow one another in a
cinematograph.&nbsp; At last it all was over, and we were free to
mount.&nbsp; Such sort of drives are of the nature of a sport in
South America, and so the Brazilian drove off the horses that we
had rejected, half a mile away, leaving them with a negro boy to
herd, remarking that the rejected were as good or better than
those that we had bought, and after cinching up his horse,
prepared to ride with us.&nbsp; Before we started, a young man
rode up, dressed like an exaggerated gaucho, in loose black
trousers, poncho, and a &ldquo;golilla&rdquo; <a
name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a> round his neck, a lazo hanging from
the saddle, a pair of boleadoras peeping beneath his
&ldquo;cojinillo,&rdquo; <a name="citation194b"></a><a
href="#footnote194b" class="citation">[194b]</a> and a long
silver knife stuck in his belt.&nbsp; It seemed <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>he was the
son of an estanciero who was studying law in Buenos Aires, but
had returned for his vacation, and hearing of our drive had come
to ride with us and help us in our task.&nbsp; No one on such
occasions is to be despised, so, thanking him for his good
intentions, to which he answered that he was a &ldquo;partizan of
the Allies, lover of liberty and truth, and was well on in all
his studies, especially in International Law,&rdquo; we mounted,
the gauchos floating almost imperceptibly, without an effort, to
their seats, the European with that air of escalading a
ship&rsquo;s side that differentiates us from man less
civilised.</p>
<p>During the operations with the Brazilian, the horses had been
let out of the corral to feed, and now were being held back <i>en
pastoreo</i>, as it is called in Uruguay, that is to say, watched
at a little distance by mounted men.&nbsp; Nothing remained but
to drive out of the corral the horses bought from the Brazilian,
and let them join the larger herd.&nbsp; Out they came like a
string of wild geese, neighing and looking round, and then
instinctively made towards the others that were feeding, and were
swallowed up amongst them.&nbsp; Slowly we rode <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>towards the
herd, sending on several well-mounted men upon its flanks, and
with precaution&mdash;for of all living animals tame horses most
easily take fright upon the march and separate&mdash;we got them
into motion, on a well-marked trail that led towards the gate of
Bopicu&aacute;.</p>
<p>At first they moved a little sullenly, and as if
surprised.&nbsp; Then the contagion of emotion that spreads so
rapidly amongst animals upon the march seemed to inspire them,
and the whole herd broke into a light trot.&nbsp; That is the
moment that a stampede may happen, and accordingly we pulled our
horses to a walk, whilst the men riding on the flanks forged
slowly to the front, ready for anything that might occur.&nbsp;
Gradually the trot slowed down, and we saw as it were a sea of
manes and tails in front of us, emerging from a cloud of dust,
from which shrill neighings and loud snortings rose.&nbsp; They
reached a hollow, in which were several pools, and stopped to
drink, all crowding into the shallow water, where they stood
pawing up the mud and drinking greedily.&nbsp; Time pressed, and
as we knew that there was water in the pasture where they were to
sleep, we <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>drove them back upon the trail, the water dripping from
their muzzles and their tails, and the black mud clinging to the
hair upon their fetlocks, and in drops upon their backs.&nbsp;
Again they broke into a trot, but this time, as they had got into
control, we did not check them, for there was still a mile to
reach the gate.</p>
<p>Passing some smaller mud-holes, the body of a horse lay near
to one of them, horribly swollen, and with its stiff legs hoisted
a little in the air by the distension of its flanks.&nbsp; The
passing horses edged away from it in terror, and a young roan
snorted and darted like an arrow from the herd.&nbsp; Quick as
was the dart he made, quicker still El Correntino wheeled his
horse on its hind legs and rushed to turn him back.&nbsp; With
his whip whirling round his head he rode to head the truant, who,
with tail floating in the air, had got a start of him of about
fifty yards.&nbsp; We pressed instinctively upon the horses; but
not so closely as to frighten them, though still enough to be
able to stop another of them from cutting out.&nbsp; The
Correntino on a half-tamed grey, which he rode with a raw-hide
thong bound round <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>its lower jaw, for it was still unbitted, swaying with
every movement in his saddle, which he hardly seemed to grip, so
perfect was his balance, rode at a slight angle to the runaway
and gained at every stride.&nbsp; His hat blew back and kept in
place by a black ribbon underneath his chin, framed his head like
an aureole.&nbsp; The red silk handkerchief tied loosely round
his neck fluttered beneath it, and as he dashed along, his lazo
coiled upon his horse&rsquo;s croup, rising and falling with each
bound, his eyes fixed on the flying roan, he might have served a
sculptor as the model for a centaur, so much did he and the wild
colt he rode seem indivisible.</p>
<p>In a few seconds, which to us seemed minutes, for we feared
the infection might have spread to the whole
&ldquo;caballada,&rdquo; the Correntino headed and turned the
roan, who came back at three-quarter speed, craning his neck out
first to one side, then to the other, as if he still thought that
a way lay open for escape.</p>
<p>By this time we had reached the gates of Bopicu&aacute;, and
still seven miles lay between us and our camping-ground, with a
fast-declining <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>sun.&nbsp; As the horses passed the gate we counted
them, an operation of some difficulty when time presses and the
count is large.&nbsp; Nothing is easier than to miss animals,
that is to say, for Europeans, however practised, but the
lynx-eyed gauchos never are at fault.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the
little brown horse with a white face, and a bit broken out of his
near forefoot?&rdquo; they will say, and ten to one that horse is
missing, for what they do not know about the appearance of a
horse would not fill many books.&nbsp; Only a drove road lay
between Bopicu&aacute; and the great pasture, at whose faraway
extremity the horses were to sleep.&nbsp; When the last animal
had passed and the great gates swung to, the young law student
rode up to my side, and, looking at the &ldquo;great
tropilla,&rdquo; as he called it, said, &ldquo;<i>Morituri te
salutant</i>.&nbsp; This is the last time they will feed in
Bopicu&aacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; We turned a moment, and the falling
sun lit up the undulating plain, gilding the cottony tufts of the
long grasses, falling upon the dark-green leaves of the low trees
around Parodi&rsquo;s camp, glinting across the belt of wood that
fringed the Uruguay, and striking full upon a white estancia
house in <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Entre-Rios, making it appear quite close at hand,
although four leagues away.</p>
<p>Two or three hundred yards from the great gateway stood a
little native hut, as unsophisticated, but for a telephone, as
were the gaucho&rsquo;s huts in Uruguay, as I remember them full
thirty years ago.&nbsp; A wooden barrel on a sledge for bringing
water had been left close to the door, at which the occupant sat
drinking mat&eacute;, tapping with a long knife upon his
boot.&nbsp; Under a straw-thatched shelter stood a saddled horse,
and a small boy upon a pony slowly drove up a flock of
sheep.&nbsp; A blue, fine smoke that rose from a few smouldering
logs and bones, blended so completely with the air that one was
not quite sure if it was really smoke or the reflection of the
distant Uruguay against the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Not far off lay the bones of a dead horse, with bits of hide
adhering to them, shrivelled into mere parchment by the
sun.&nbsp; All this I saw as in a camera-lucida, seated a little
sideways on my horse, and thinking sadly that I, too, had looked
my last on Bopicu&aacute;.&nbsp; It is not given to all men after
a break of years to come back to the scenes of youth, and still
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>find in
them the same zest as of old.&nbsp; To return again to all the
cares of life called civilised, with all its littlenesses, its
newspapers all full of nothing, its sordid aims disguised under
high-sounding nicknames, its hideous riches and its sordid
poverty, its want of human sympathy, and, above all, its
barbarous war brought on it by the folly of its rulers, was not
just at that moment an alluring thought, as I felt the little
&ldquo;malacara&rdquo; <a name="citation201"></a><a
href="#footnote201" class="citation">[201]</a> that I rode
twitching his bridle, striving to be off.&nbsp; When I had
touched him with the spur he bounded forward and soon overtook
the caballada, and the place which for so many months&rsquo; had
been part of my life sank out of sight, just as an island in the
Tropics fades from view as the ship leaves it, as it were, hull
down.</p>
<p>When we had passed into the great enclosure of La Pileta, and
still four or five miles remained to go, we pressed the caballada
into a long trot, certain that the danger of a stampede was
past.&nbsp; Wonderful and sad it was to ride behind so many
horses, trampling knee-high through the wild grasses of the <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Camp,
snorting and biting at each other, and all unconscious that they
would never more career across the plains.&nbsp; Strange and
affecting, too, to see how those who had known each other all
kept together in the midst of the great herd, resenting all
attempts of their companions to separate them.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;tropilla&rdquo; <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a> that we had bought
from a Frenchman called Leon, composed of five brown horses, had
ranged itself around its bell mare, a fine chestnut, like a
bodyguard.&nbsp; They fought off any of the other horses who came
near her, and seemed to look at her both with affection and with
pride.</p>
<p>Two little bright bay horses, with white legs and noses, that
were brothers, and what in Uruguay are known as
&ldquo;seguidores,&rdquo; that is, one followed the other
wherever it might go, ran on the outskirts of the herd.&nbsp;
When either of them stopped to eat, its companion turned its head
and neighed to it, when it came galloping up.&nbsp; Arena, our
head man, riding beside me on a skewbald, looked at them, and,
after dashing forward to turn a runaway, wheeled round his horse
almost in <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>the air and stopped it in a bound, so suddenly that for
an instant they stood poised like an equestrian statue, looked at
the &ldquo;seguidores,&rdquo; and remarked, &ldquo;Patron, I hope
one shell will kill them both in the Great War if they have got
to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not answer, except to curse the Boches
with all the intensity the Spanish tongue commands.&nbsp; The
young law-student added his testimony, and we rode on in
silence.</p>
<p>A passing sleeve of locusts almost obscured the declining
sun.&nbsp; Some flew against our faces, reminding me of the fight
Cortes had with the Indians not far from Vera Cruz, which, Bernal
Diaz says, was obstructed for a moment by a flight of locusts
that came so thickly that many lost their lives by the neglect to
raise their bucklers against what they thought were locusts, and
in reality were arrows that the Indians shot.&nbsp; The effect
was curious as the insects flew against the horses, some clinging
to their manes, and others making them bob up and down their
heads, just as a man does in a driving shower of hail.&nbsp; We
reached a narrow causeway that formed the passage through a
marsh.&nbsp; On it the horses <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>crowded, making us hold our breath
for fear that they would push each other off into the mud, which
had no bottom, upon either side.&nbsp; When we emerged and
cantered up a little hill, a lake lay at the bottom of it, and
beyond it was a wood, close to a railway siding.&nbsp; The
evening now was closing in, but there was still a good half-hour
of light.&nbsp; As often happens in South America just before
sundown, the wind dropped to a dead calm, and passing little
clouds of locusts, feeling the night approach, dropped into the
long grass just as a flying-fish drops into the waves, with a
harsh whirring of their gauzy wings.</p>
<p>The horses smelt the water at the bottom of the hill, and the
whole five hundred broke into a gallop, manes flying, tails
raised high, and we, feeling somehow the gallop was the last,
raced madly by their side until within a hundred yards or so of
the great lake.&nbsp; They rushed into the water and all drank
greedily, the setting sun falling upon their many-coloured backs,
and giving the whole herd the look of a vast tulip field.&nbsp;
We kept away so as to let them drink their fill, and then,
leading our horses to the margin of the lake, dismounted, <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>and, taking
out their bits, let them drink, with the air of one accomplishing
a rite, no matter if they raised their heads a dozen times and
then began again.</p>
<p>Slowly Arena, El Correntino, Paralelo, Suarez, and the rest
drove out the herd to pasture in the deep lush grass.&nbsp; The
rest of us rode up some rising ground towards the wood.&nbsp;
There we drew up, and looking back towards the plain on which the
horses seemed to have dwindled to the size of sheep in the
half-light, some one, I think it was Arena, or perhaps Pablo
Suarez, spoke their elegy: &ldquo;Eat well,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;there is no grass like that of La Pileta, to where you go
across the sea.&nbsp; The grass in Europe all must smell of
blood.&rdquo;</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
